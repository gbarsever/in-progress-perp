Yeah 
It 's like Jesus Christ Well when you get you know when you get right down to it the uh the more they can do for you the more uh like I say the more the more memory they 're going to require 
Yeah 
Yeah 
Yeah 
Both both in terms in Ram as well as uh you know standard memory or disk mem- disk base 
Yeah 
so Well like they say like nobody can get enough you know 
It 's like once you have something and it 's like Oh yeah 
You find out more 
I was watching this program on yesterday 
In nineteen seventy-six came up with Three graphics 
Yeah 
Right 
Uh-huh 
And they were showing this like Three g- Three graphics view of like Like the MUMBLEx deal 
What 
No 
no 
no 
Like a hologram 
This is like this is like video game stuff 
With just graphics on on a Okay 
Okay 
But the only thing was that it was just lines 
okay 
Like if you Well what d- do you think in terms of uh benefits 
Well personally you know I think you know of course I 'm sure we 're familiar with the exact same benefit package 
and I think that uh we 've probably got one of the best around you know 
besides they tend to offer ad- adequate vacation I guess 
And the paid time off is wonderful 
and uh one of the things that we were just talking about as a matter of fact this week at work was the Plan that is offered 
and I think that is just a a fabulous one 
so I do n't know if you participate in that or not 
but Absolutely 
is n't it great 
It 's just a it 's just a miracle that how fast that adds up you know 
Well I have to agree with that 
You know I was thinking about uh importance of benefits and that kind of thing other than salary while I was waiting for uh the system to find a a respondent 
Uh-huh 
Uh-huh 
And I started thinking that over the years that importance has changed 
and I suspect that that 's probably true for everyone 
Yeah 
When I was much younger it was uh less important to consider retirement and less important to consider medical benefits 
But as I grow older and my family grows it the medical benefits are more important 
and the retirement is more important 
I had never really thought of it that way 
but I guess that 's true I guess that 's true 
I 'm still young enough that that uh the vacation 's real important to me 
and the paid time off is real important to me and and that kind of thing 
But uh you know I was just as a matter of fact I just uh celebrated my fifth year at I the end of last month and uh kind of started looking through the the book because of that you know 
now that I 'm a hundred percent vested you know you kind of look through the book and see well what exactly what does that mean and what is the pension all about 
and you know when you 're when you 're you know in your I 'm only in my late twenties now 
so you tend not to think about retirement 
But uh it 's I guess now is the time to think about it 
so Does I have a pretty good retirement package do you think 
I think they have uh a- one that we need to recognize that we 're going to have to supplement ourselves 
Yeah 
And that 's certainly one of the reasons that I 'm sure that they 've begun the uh Plan 
Uh-huh 
It 's certainly a a supplemental way uh 
Uh-huh 
and I suppose if b- maybe in in your instance if if you 're started with I in your early to mid-twenties and happen to stay with them until you 're sixty-five then you 'll have a very good retirement plan 
Right 
But I had another career first and then came to I a little later 
Uh-huh 
So it 's not uh all by itself it wo n't be adequate for for my situation 
It 's not going to build up quite enough 
yeah 
So I have to find a way to supplement that 
Yeah 
Well they just they seem to make it so easy to save 
You know one of the things that we 're doing which is probably the worst investment in the world but I 've got money coming out MUMBLEx to buy savings bonds just coming straight out of my check 
And it 's probably not a great investment 
but if I was n't doing that the money would n't be being saved anyway you know 
I kind of have to trade off you know 
If you never see it you do n't spend it 
so And it 's I unders- understand though 
it Yeah 
Uh believe me I do that myself 
Do you 
Yeah 
And I disagree with you 
I do n't think it 's the worst investment in the world 
Do you really not 
I I fr- you know I I debate about whether it 's really good or not you know 
Well it 's in terms of guaranteed return on investment and maybe you do n't start looking for that word guaranteed until later 
Yeah 
Yeah 
Uh it 's shown a history that uh sure beats anything else Over many many years 
Yeah 
that 's true 
That 's very true 
We went uh and did a a thing through I which is a like a financial consultant type thing here in Dallas 
and uh one of the things that we talked about with the counselor there was you know they work up this whole big you know proposal profile for you that ev- all the things that you need to work on and you need to do 
And then one of the things that we talked about with her was you know the need to save for our son 's education 
We have a two year old you know 
and and you know we ca n't start saving for college when he 's sixteen you know 
we have to do that now 
And and uh they have a way that they can figure you know what you know and he 's two now 
in sixteen years when he 's ready to go to college this is how much it 'll cost you know 
and it 's just really scary the thought of how much it 's going to it 's what it costs now is ridiculous 
what it 's going to cost sixteen years from now is just really scary 
And they sat down and figured up that we needed to save like between fifteen and seventeen hundred dollars a year at a oh you know six percent interest rate to be able to have you know money for his college 
And that 's exactly what we have coming out in saving bonds is is you know about fifteen hundred dollars a year 
So I guess it you know in that way at least we know that that 's taken care of you know 
We we can worry about other things 
so I understand that approach 
Yeah 
That 's what that 's exactly what 's happening in my family 
Yeah 
Is it really 
Yeah 
Un- except that mine are a little bit older 
and and I 've shown them the numbers and said this is what 's going to be available 
all this is going to do is give you a little spending money while you 're there 
Uh-huh 
You better make sure that you 've got a scholarship 
That 's right 
That 's right 
Well that 's what she said to us 
She said now do you all want him to go to a a state college or a private college 
And and our answer was that you know we will have enough money available for him to attend a state college 
And if he wants to go to a private college he can get a scholarship to attend you know 
And that was kind of our view on it 
It just costs too much 
you just ca n't do it you know 
So I do n't know 
it 's it 's I do n't uh it just amazing 
it amazes me how much the the costs are going to go up over the next ten or fifteen years 
I just do n't know how anybody 's going to do it 
I know 
And boy it gets really scary when you start talking to them 
Uh I have a an eleven year old daughter now who 's saying gee Dad I want to be an allergist 
Oh goodness 
and I said that 's wonderful 
I applaud that 
Let me explain to you how you get scholarships to do that 
Yeah 
Yeah 
Exactly 
And then her little brother 's only two years behind 
Exactly 
and he says well I do n't know 
I think that I probably want to be a veterinarian 
And I said that 's great 
Let me explain to you how you get scholarships to do that 
That 's right 
That 's right 
Well you know I you know I offers some good stuff 
and then I think there 's I mean I think there 's some negatives 
but there 's going to be some negatives anywhere you know no matter where you go 
I have you know all this is the first really large company I 've worked for I 've 
always been involved in little small you know ind- privately owned s- owned firms 
and so I 've never had the the big benefit package 
So I really do n't know how to compare it to other big companies you know 
It when I came on it was great because I had never had anything even close to what what they offered 
So I 've been real pleased 
Well that 's fantastic 
Yeah 
and on whole o- I would say that they 're equal to uh most of our competitors 
Think so 
Uh I can see some some potential changes that probably are are would not cost very much but might uh make things a little easier Such as offering a a smorgasbord Having a larger variety of benefits 
Uh-huh 
but but here 's the amount that that I is going to pay for it 
Yeah 
Yeah 
and you can pick what you want 
and yeah 
now it 's up to you 
it 's menu selection so to speak 
Right 
That sounds really good 
I read a thing 
I do n't even remember if it was in the or the one about uh companies allowing you and they said that I was looking into it to purchase extra vacation days Which I thought sounded like a good idea 
You know if you 've been there you know under five years and you get two weeks of vacation 
but that 's really not enough 
and you want an extra week then you can purchase an extra week of vacation by saying okay I 'm going to want an extra five days this year 
and they 'll take a set amount out of each paycheck you know 
and they 're deducting it all along 
so you you can have an extra five days off and be paid for them at the time you know 
you 're really not being paid for them 
the money is actually coming out of your own pocket 
but it 's coming out a little bit at a time instead of all at once you know 
So that is kind of an idea that that a lot of people sounded like that they were really interested in 
and I said that they were looking into something like that 
so Well I could certainly personally stand seeing them go to a a standardized compensatory time for overtime 
Uh-huh 
Uh-huh 
And I do n't believe any of us would have to purchase any extra vacation days if they did that 
Well true 
True 
Uh and and I would certainly support something like four to one or five to one 
or or you know maybe they want to get generous and make it three to one Uh a- as a repayment for every three to five days that I work overtime there they should give me one day 
Uh-huh 
Yeah 
Yeah 
Yeah 
But it should be a standard and and not left up to either the whim or the current overhead rate t- uh that 's running in each department 
Uh-huh 
Well 
and yeah 
and and a lot of that is left up to whoever your supervisor happens to be and what type of relationship you have with that person 
and you know I see a lot of differences but from one group to the next you know about who gets it and who does n't get it you know 
But that 's and that 's that way with a lot of things you know there 
It seems like it depends on what what group you happen to be in what what you 're going to get and what you 're not going to get 
so Well that 's for sure 
Which is the same 
but but then it 's probably that way anywhere you know 
that 's Oh I 'm sure personalities always come into play 
Uh-huh 
Uh just in this size of organization Okay 
The question was um what what is your opinion of youth uh spending a year or two in in public service 
I think it would be a great idea 
I 'm not sure about requiring it you know of people because people are going you know feeling resentful 
I do n't know 
but I think it would be a great idea 
Yeah 
Seems like there 's so many kids that do n't have any since of you know what they want to be or do 
or you know they could learn something and maybe help other people at the same time 
and we sure our country all countries sure need help 
so Huh-uh 
Would uh would you be more in favor of uh you know like a local uh my only experience with it I was in Central America for a while and uh in San Salvador in El Salvador 
Huh-uh 
Huh-uh 
For instance everybody had what they called there social year that they had to put in 
Oh really 
and basically it was a uh repayment for for uh high school education 
Huh-uh 
and most of them joined the Red Cross 
and it was done internally 
I just there was very little external 
I think possibly what uh they 're thinking about here more external Peace Corps Type things where we 're sending people off shore 
Yeah 
Well I think that would be real interesting for people to do 
but I guess my concern about that would be the cost involved trying to train people in a new language and ship them you know to other countries 
Huh-uh 
and but I do n't know 
If you did it internally and it was just people in your own country then maybe countries that are so poor that they would n't be able to really you know send children to do that Yeah 
I did n't know 
I do n't I do n't know how the Peace Corps works 
I guess I was of age when the Peace Corps came in and all that 
Yeah 
I was too 
I thought seriously about joining at that time 
I thought it was a fantastic idea 
Did you ever get any information on it like I sent off for stuff on it 
but I do n't remember that much about it 
I know that they trained you in the language 
and um That 's what I was wondering about was whether they actually You actually got paid too while in the Peace Corps 
it was n't much 
Yeah 
but I guess they you could put some money aside while you were there your expenses and Was n't Jimmy Carter 's mama that was in the Peace Corps 
Yeah 
I think so 
yeah 
yeah 
But it might be interesting to see what would happen if you took kids at a and then took then to another country instead of having being exposed to all the drugs and violence and sex and everything here and take them to some other country that had different moral values like Saudi Arabia where they could n't drink 
Where they could n't do that 
Yeah 
you might end up with a revolution 
I do n't know which end though 
Really 
Yeah 
yeah 
That 's that 's been interesting though the kids that have been over you know coming back right now you know 
Yeah 
You wonder if being exposed to that for a while what percentage of them would actually say Hey that 's not a bad way to do it 
because from what I understand from some of the guys I know you know crime uh is punishable just almost uh instantly and public 
Public hanging 
yeah 
Public hanging and this sort of thing you know 
so you do n't have just a whole lot of what we consider street crimes 
Yeah 
Yeah 
I 've heard that like in China and stuff there is virtually no such thing as rape because if you rape somebody you 'd be murdered you know on the you know street 
so Yeah 
Well I guess that 's uh the price of freedom I guess is a little anyway 
the uh uh the the public service thing again I I I guess in my own having had the whole three or four minutes to you know give it a great deal of thought you know Um I I think I agree with you one hundred percent about it being some sort of voluntary 
but when you do that then it becomes almost uh a MUMBLEx or it can be 
Yeah 
You know there have people will kind of set up their own little club 
Yeah 
that 's true 
And uh but if you know People that might benefit most from it might not go in that situation you know like people that really are trapped in a ghetto or something like that 
Yeah 
Might not go if it was voluntary 
but I do n't know how they 'd enforce it 
if it was Yeah 
well if they went what are you going to do 
Yeah 
Shoot them 
Put them in jail 
I do n't know 
Send them over to Iraq 
Yeah 
right 
Have a vacation in Iraq for a year 
I know my dad always talked about uh he was in during uh Yeah 
And he was uh a rock rib Iowa type republican 
and the only good thing he could ever say about uh the whole Roosevelt administration was uh civilian conservation corps 
Huh-uh 
because he was in it 
He thought that was great 
Yeah 
The rest of it was all hog wash 
but that was great 
Well it seems like it would develop pride you know in people if if it 's in their own country 
It would certainly help them to appreciate some of the things that we have here and develop some pride in them if it was handled that way 
I I it would take quite a few people 
I think it might build jobs for people you know that were administrating and running and training and coordinating and all that 
so maybe that part of it would be helpful too 
Yeah 
I do n't know 
Yeah 
the only Like to have a volunteer come here and rake leaves and mow the grass and Well you know that brings up the interesting subject too you know 
what would you have who who who would determine what these people do 
Yeah 
yeah 
You know if uh you know if it 's run by the individual state You know like was run by the army 
and in effect Huh-uh 
and the only opposition to it really was that it was you know starting some sort of a military elitist type you know special corps of cadre of people and that sort of thing 
Huh-uh 
And uh when the politics get real confusing Yeah 
really there could be um some scandals involved if you know it was n't people that were really fair and le- you know in a legal way or something 
Yeah 
they could send all the people over to uh you know one particular part of town or one particular project that somebody had paid somebody to you know get supported 
or Yeah 
Well MUMBLEx We 've gotten to the point where you know if if well if the racial make up of the group was such and such you know they 'd have to do that percentage of work and what is perceived to be that part of town and you know That kind of thing 
Yeah 
That could be a complicated too could n't it 
Oh yeah 
Yeah 
Suppose uh well you know they had a group who were construction oriented 
and they went and they they built uh ca n't think of a good example a swimming pool or anything you know 
and one you can you can only build it in one place you know 
and know matter where you build it somebody else is going to scream well you did n't build one over here 
Yeah 
That 's true 
Unfair or something 
yeah 
Yeah 
I think uh oh boy 
It 's one of those things on the surface you know it seems like a great idea 
It 's like a joke I heard once about uh elephant foot soup you know 
it 's easy to do once you find a elephant foot 
It 's uh the logistics of the thing that uh gets you going 
Yeah 
Really 
Yeah 
Well it seems like there 's there 's a lot you do n't hear much on the news about young people really you know wanting to do anything good or anything like that 
but you know I 'm sure that there are a lot of young people out there that really do have good hearts and are willing to help and serve and that kind of thing 
I just I saw on the news the other night that the uh the little girl that used to be the littlest girl on the Cosby show Kisha Knight Pullman was starting a I guess now she 's practically a teenager 
Yeah 
She started some type of um national organization for youth to volunteer to teach tutor other kids to read and you know do different service projects like that and trying to get youth more directed towards you know helpful things 
and I know everyone like in the high schools in Dallas 
there 's a couple high schools that have wanted to start like a um minority you know I think it was in a Hispanic area 
they wanted to start like a club for the teenagers instead of they said all these gangs kids could join to belong 
Huh-uh 
But they did n't have anything positive the kids could be doing helping you know 
Yeah 
so they were trying to start that out 
so if there 's people out there that are willing to you know kids that are willing to sacrifice their time and energy Gosh we ought to use them You know If they 're willing to do it 
Yeah 
Yeah 
it 's it 's it 's just the you know here you are to the logistics of the thing again you know 
Yeah 
Who 's going to run it you know 
what 
how 
oh it 's just so many Yeah 
Like like I said at the beginning I 've got so many connections with people in Central America 
My daughter-in-law is Panamanian you know 
Huh-uh 
and they have situations like like that down there Where they they have these the social in some sort of way Huh-uh 
if you want to go to school outside the country and many Salvadorians did they 'd go to school in Cornell Iowa of all places 
Huh-uh 
and when they came back they 'd have to serve this this year 
and it turned out to be kind of a joke 
the ones I knew you know always chose the Red Cross because they did n't do anything 
Oh I see 
And they had all kinds of uh things they could go into agricultural and you know Really good stuff 
Yeah 
but uh unless there was a flood or a fire or something like that Red Cross it was so many of them in it that at any particular chance your chance of having to do something was it was very slim 
Yeah 
Yeah 
And so Well we um belong to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints which is like MUMBLEx the Mormon church 
Huh-uh 
Huh-uh 
And um there there is men and also women 
women are n't nearly as frequent 
and also that have elderly couples once their kids have left that can volunteer to go on a mission 
and um they 're all over the world 
And it 's incredible logistics 
I mean they have a training center where they teach them 
it 's called the Missionary Training Center in Utah 
and they have to be taught the language and customs and all those kinds of things 
Yeah 
and then they um you know go and actually live in that country for the the uh young men do it for two years and the young women for eighteen months 
Okay 
Then that 's uh kind of a private organization 
Right 
you know I 'm I 'm familiar with my instructor pilot was a Mormon 
he was he was a good construction uh you know in- instructor pilot because he considered himself indestructible 
Oh yeah 
He had a direct connection somewhere uh 
Yeah 
right 
He felt that he really had an in 
so You know things he would do with an airplane 
Yeah 
but any rate that 's off the subject 
Yeah 
But I They they do n't get paid for it 
and um but there is funding that comes 
they 're supposedly saving up on their own 
and the church helps them out some 
Huh-uh 
but you know that it is incredible you know 
I see how they were organized in Central and South America 
Yeah 
and uh it 's uh Yeah 
Well um with credit cards is me I uh I try to get maybe just one or two 
I do n't I do n't like having credit cards for every store 
I I uh I just do n't like them 
What are you afraid of with them 
What am I afraid of 
Yes 
Um I do n't know if I 'm really afraid of spending too much 
I just uh do n't think that I need them you know 
I uh they are tempting at times 
but I I just you know sometimes I just do n't like everybody knowing everything about me you know 
so Well that 's very can be very very true 
So and th- you know everybody just gives you a credit card just so you 'll spend money 
so Well that 's the idea 
They figure that if they give you card at no charge for a whole year that you will use it 
Yeah 
Uh-huh 
and That 's right 
See they make money off of it whether you use it or not 
Absolutely 
Well the other thing of course is the fact that they hope you will not pay your bill at the end of the month so that you would be paying interest 
That 's right 
Uh-huh 
I use mine a great deal um for groceries for everything that I can and then just write one check at the end of the month for the entire thing 
Uh-huh 
That 's what I do 
right 
That 's what I do 
Just a second 
Sorry 
That 's all right 
Sounds like you have a little one there 
I have two little ones 
Yes 
Oh you have 
Yeah 
So tha- Great 
How old are they 
MUMBLEx um four and two and half 
Oh boy Those are two very active ages 
Yes 
So yeah 
um I 'm I 'm like you 
I I use my only use my credit card for um you know when I you know I just use it whenever I feel like I do n't want to write a check 
and then but I do n't charge anything that I ca n't payoff at the end of the month 
Uh-huh 
So Well uh do you uh do you ever use the A machines 
No 
I never do 
My husband does at work just to get cash out 
but uh I take the checkbook 
so I you know I just if I need cash I just tell him 
and he gets it out 
and I do n't even think I know my number 
Well I find it a great use from the standpoint that you do n't have to continue to write checks in order to get cash 
Uh-huh 
That 's right 
See we he could n't do without it h- but you know since he can just do it right there at work for nothing 
Oh that helps 
Right 
Yeah 
Well the the other thing some people are not aware of is they will use their A their credit card like their Visa or their MasterCard for cash 
Uh-huh 
and when they do that they begin paying interest right from that very day on 
You 're right 
And that 's kind of silly 
Yeah right 
Absolutely 
Yeah 
Because they they figure that that 's correct 
You 're defeating the purpose 
The idea is to use their money 
Yeah
