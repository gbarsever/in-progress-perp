And then one of them said well everything is great 
but I 'm going to give it thumbs down 
And they go 
but why 
Because it 's like the end is like really depressing 
And so Oh 
But it but it 's like the movie is so well made 
and the music that goes with it just picks you up see I was never I was born in nineteen hundred sixty-nine 
Oh okay 
So I mean so for me So you did n't really grow up with that kind of music then 
No 
but you learn to 
I mean it 's just that like the the sixties music 's got a lot to say 
Right 
I I never found out what a lot of the seventies music had too 
You know I was like Well no 
now well seventies music I mean I 'm like I said yo- disco I do n't like disco 
I 've never liked disco 
Hey 
but I bet you were out there with your bell bottomed pants 
Well that 's true 
That 's true 
But I was more in the late seven- well I shou- like mid to late seventies like between seventy-five and and seventy-nine was more my era 
Yeah 
yeah 
Did did you go to college 
Well no 
I 'm going right now 
Oh that 's cool 
But uh no 
I did n't go then 
But see I graduated high school in seventy-eight 
Okay 
so you know in seventy-eight you know rock was starting to get really heavy you know 
and real um I do n't know 
Yeah 
yeah 
disco was pretty much dead by then 
Yeah 
So so that 's what I mean 
disco was n't really my time 
Well they always say that the seventies was the lowest point in in progression ever in history 
So About music 
No 
about everything 
Oh Okay 
So it 's like nothing happened during the seventies 
Everything happened during the sixties 
the seventies I do n't know what they 're called you know 
it 's like like the the eighties are called like the progressive years or the or you know like the technology years because of all the computers and stuff 
Uh-huh 
But the seventies got nothing 
I mean nobody cared to name it 
That 's kind of funny 
So 
You 're right 
I never thought of that 
The disco years that 's what they 're calling them are gone 
Yeah 
I know 
Can you imagine the like a big picture of John Travolta ta-da what is it 
Him just standing there 
Yeah 
right 
Yeah 
that 's a good example to look for in history 
Well from now on we 're going to go from the from nineteen sixty-nine when they took the first step on the moon to nineteen eighties 
Okay 
what happened in the middle 
Do n't worry 
do n't worry 
you 're not you 're not missing anything you know 
so That 's true 
Well except for Vietnam 
Yeah 
really 
And that 's that 's why I guess everybody You know with yeah 
it 's like they do n't want to talk about that 
so they just do n't name it 
I mean it was it was I guess it was pretty bad times 
Yeah 
Well that 's very true 
But Oh well let 's see 
yeah 
okay 
we 've been talking for seven minutes 
so Oh good 
I have n't even been keeping track 
Okay 
all right 
so um I 'm going to leave you alone 
Uh what what are you doing 
Do you have a family 
Uh yeah 
Okay 
We 're kind of I was kind of in the middle of supper 
but it 's not a big deal 
Oh I 'm sorry 
I just left it 
No 
it 's okay 
because see I did n't see somebody tried to call me last night 
but I did n't have my number yet 
I just got it today 
Oh okay 
And so you know it 's okay 
I I told them I 'd be available during this time 
so anyway 
Okay 
All right 
So then uh have fun doing this 
It is not that bad 
Okay

Bye bye 
Great 
Bye 
Hi Diana 
Hi 
Have you all been able to do much as a family these days 
Pardon me 
Have you all been able to do much as uh as a full family these days all of you 
Oh yes 
we 've uh been um we 've gone other you know all kinds of places 
we go out to dinner 
Yeah 
we take the kids to the park 
and uh you know whenever we he my husband has time off or something we take them to the zoo 
or we you know we do everything we can possibly as a family 
Do you work outside the home 
No 
I do n't 
Yeah 
I do n't either 
it makes it a little bit easier I think that way 
Yeah 
it does 
an an then uh you know my husband enjoys spending time with the kids you know 
he 'll he 'll take them out just to be with them 
Yeah 
So he they can have time with him an 
So you have a break too 
Right 
so and we uh we try to teach our kids as much as we can at home you know we have we try to spend like Monday nights we call it family home evening and have our kids uh you know have little lessons with them and you know just see count see how things are going in our family and you know teach them about their grandparents or something like that Bring out pictures of them so they get to know them 
Uh-huh 
and we just do all kinds of fun things like that 
an Yeah 
we have family that 's far away 
It sounds like you might too 
Yeah 
we do 
so they you know the only way they know their grandparents is by pictures 
Yeah 
And uh Right 
and phone calls that 's about about it 
Yeah 
right 
and uh you know they we you know we go to the park 
or we go in the backyard and sit down 
an That 's wha- yeah that 's what we mostly do pretty simple things 
Yeah 
Especially since my youngest one is excuse me only fourteen months 
Right 
She she 's really getting to the age where she 's playing and likes to go places 
Uh-huh 
Yeah 
and with you know me being at home and just having the one income you know you do n't have this lot of extra money to to do a lot of you know extra things 
That 's right 
So you you make more fun than you know You know the kids just think it 's wonderful just maybe to go get an ice cream cone or yeah or uh you know go get a bag of and 's or something like that 
Oh that 's a big thrill for them 
they they think that 's a lot of fun 
So we just we try to spend as much time as we can 
We you know our our whole weekends are divi- are devoted to our children except for we might go out you know one evening or something 
Yeah 
but during the day you know it 's all devoted to our kids 
and they come go to church with us 
and so Yeah 
that 's true 
Yeah 
so Have um have you ever been to the Science it 's called the Science Place 
Yes 
yes 
that 's what We ju- we have n't lived here too long 
and we went there a couple of weeks ago 
and uh Uh-huh 
the kids thought that was wonderful 
Oh yeah 
we I guess there 's Science Place One and Science Place Two 
We 've only been in I think it 's Science Place Two 
I is I 'm not sure which one we went into 
it was about a year or so ago when we went 
The one we went in had uh the thing that sticks out most in my mind is that like a kid 's place area 
Uh-huh 
yeah 
That really seem they really seemed to go wild in there 
Yeah 
yeah 
they had a lot of fun in there 
and uh there 's uh there 's some petting you know like uh uh I think it 's Owens Country Farms has a free petting you know like a farm that you can go to 
and the kids can pet animals and stuff 
Where 's that 
That 's on Plano Road 
uh it 's like in Richardson you go up Plano Road 
it 's like a little bit past Campbell and Plano Road 
Uh-huh 
uh-huh 
And that 's a lot of fun 
Oh yeah 
They have tours going through there 
and uh the kids think that was a lot of fun too 
Oh that does sound like fun 
It 's a little bit of a ways 
We take you know whenever we take them to Showbiz or they think it 's wonderful just to go to McDonald 's you know 
they do n't go for the food 
they go for the to play around 
and There 's another place in Mesquite called Monkey Business 
That 's right 
Uh-huh 
and it 's a indoor fun park 
and it has a bunch of different rides for kids 
That 's sounds fun too 
And parents get in free 
and it 's like during the week 
it 's like five dollars admission per child all day 
And and you said about Plano and Campbell is the petting 
The petting farm 
yeah 
That sounds fun 
I think maybe we 'll try to do that 
Yeah 
yeah 
and the one in Mesquite is uh Scyene exit 
Uh-huh 
And it 's it 's uh the kids just had a wonderful time there 
they you know you just pay that admission 
and then all the the the rides are free 
You know of course they have all the little video games and you know those little quarter rides you know to and stuff like that 
but they thought that was lot of fun 
Yeah 
You can have birthday parties there 
an I think that was better than like Showbiz Pizza cause there 's more for them to do 
Because they can just do you do n't have to have tokens for everything 
Yeah 
right 
Yeah 
So they had a lot of fun 
That does sound like fun 
Well I 've gotten some good ideas from you 
Yeah 
I we try to do a lot of things as a family and you know inexpensively as possible 
so Definitely 
Well I think I do n't know if we 've done five minutes 
but I 'm sure that will be good 
Yeah 
that will be good 
yeah 
It was good talking to you 
Well it was good talking to you 
I really appreciate your suggestions 
Oh no problem 
Well take care 
Okay 
bye-bye 
Bye-bye 
Okay uh 
my favorite show is 
and it has been for a long time 
but I feel almost ashamed to say that to anybody now because I have never met anybody who likes it 
Do you by any chance 
Oh yes 
You do 
Yes 
very much 
Well would n't you know 
As a matter of fact I prefer public television 
Uh-huh 
And uh I have particularly enjoy the English comedies and the English mysteries 
Yeah 
Yeah 
I watch mysteries too 
Is that what you 're referring to 
Yes 
Okay 
yeah 
That is good 
I like uh do you read 
Vociferously 
Okay 
well that 's the reason why I like both of those programs is because they 're kind of based on books 
Yes 
And the plots are more um challenging you know than the sitcoms of regular 
Well unfortunately for us at least here in the United States we the only access we have to that of course is public television 
Yeah 
I 'm I 'm not a great television watcher in any respect 
but uh the watching what I do watch is uh usually news and whatever is on public television 
Any kind of I also uh am very fond of great performances in that regard 
Uh-huh 
yeah 
Me too 
But uh Did you stay up late and catch this 
No 
Oh that was a scream 
no 
no 
as a matter of fact uh Turner Broadcasting has been uh broadcasting all of the James Bond movies every night this week 
Uh-huh 
Really 
so I have concentrated on watching James Bond movies this week 
I used to like him too 
he was my hero 
In fact I like Sean Connery to this day 
Well they 're showing uh at this moment 
Yeah 
and it is the first appearance of Roger Moore as double oh seven 
Yeah 
So Oh he can never cut it 
No 
no 
that 's true 
I was just thinking that today he did well in some of the later movies he looks very effeminate in his early movies 
Yeah 
Yeah 
yeah 
he does 
Whereas uh Sean Connery has maintained the uh how would you uh ruddy look 
but uh Oh yes 
Uh-huh 
yeah 
I liked his accent too 
And he can even be in movies that are not uh uh sexually oriented 
and he still comes off great 
Well you know he was when was it last year or year before last he was voted the sexiest actor in movies or something 
He is 
Yeah 
he had my vote double 
I mean the man is sixty-two years old 
I do n't care 
But uh but otherwise you know we uh with and so forth And I I particularly enjoy I do n't know whether you 've had a chance to watch it on but uh the series uh 
Yeah 
Oh what 's that about 
That was about a the Interior Minister 
it was a comedy 
Oh yeah 
yeah 
the Interior Minister of in England with the permanent secretary and bureaucracy and all that 
Uh-huh 
Right 
Right 
I I 've seen it several times 
It 's a scream 
but I have to go to bed 
I have to get up and and work the next morning 
I wish they 'd put those that 's why I say did you stay up late to watch this 
It came on after on Saturday nights here at least 
Uh-huh 
And it should of course I li- really it was I do n't think they should show it during prime time 
but still it was funny 
Yeah 
Yeah 
I know 
Well I I I 'm not much of a television watcher 
I I read as I said and uh quite a bit 
Uh-huh 
I read about two or three novels a week in addition to all the technical stuff 
Yeah 
What what do you do 
What kind of work do you do 
I 'm a Payroll Clerk 
Just an accounting clerk 
At I 
No uh 
I have a friend who works for I 
and I work for a tire service here in Oh I see 
I 'm from Dallas 
Uh-huh 
Well the last two people who have called both worked for I 
and I just wondered 
Yeah 
yeah 
it could be I -ers I think probably are participating more than anybody else 
but I needed the money 
This is five bucks here 
I think that 's something we all ca- Yeah 
really 
Do you work for I 
No 
no 
I work for In Maryland 
Really 
yes 
How did you hear oh we 're not even supposed to be talking about this though are we 
I guess not 
How did I hear about it 
Well I work you know they are gathering a data base for voice processing 
Uh-huh 
And that 's my field of work also 
Oh 
So I I know the people at I who are doing this 
and I heard about it 
so I called them and asked if I could participate And uh You know send in the forms et cetera and uh so forth 
Oh 
Right 
We could go back to television shows 
Well you know speaking of public have you caught any of this series on the Bible 
Yes 
I have 
I 've heard that it 's really against the well I mean that it 's coming out with the idea that the Bible 's not true 
Well no 
That 's uh you could interpret it that way 
Uh-huh 
Uh I I think what they are trying to say is that there is a great deal of historical truth 
but the interpretation that actually got into the writing of the Bible itself is probably uh after the what uh was is it the King James Version when the committee did it wrote the translation that so much was lost in the translation particularly since most of the translations were in Greek 
Yeah 
Well for example In Greek there are seven different words for love 
Right 
Okay 
so you can have there 's one word for love of your brother one word for love of your wife one word for you know uh love of your father and that sort of thing 
So in as to those types of interpretations uh really made a difference in how one might interpret the Bible now and what it 's at 
Uh-huh 
So that 's you know you can look at it as though they are saying it 's not true 
but there 's too much historical fact involved just from the uh the histories that are were developed around that time that are available To deny that at least the majority of it is true 
Yeah 
So you know it depends on how you look at it 
Yeah 
You can look at it you know if you want to say that it 's proven that it is n't true then you can very much look at it that way 
I guess if you 're looking for that you 're Yeah 
well Well you can interpret that the what the show in the same way that you can interpret the Bible 
that uh Uh-huh 
So Really 
But uh as as far as that goes I we at least agree on what we enjoy 
Yeah 
that 's right 
But uh I do n't know if there is there is a time limit on this so uh Yeah 
Surely we 've made it 
I think so too 
Let 's just it 's been very pleasant talking to you 
It was very nice talking to you 
and have a good evening 
You too 
Good night 
Bye-bye 
Uh well how is it appropriate to be talking about exercise attitudes 
We uh well uh my my husband is right now teaching an aerobics class 
Uh-huh 
He 's an aerobics instructor And um is going to be uh entering North Texas for uh a Kinesiology program there 
Uh-huh 
And um the the how I met him was through uh the aerobics class that he used to teach 
Uh-huh 
You 're a student 
Yeah 
so I 'm I 'm an avid aerobics uh person and just very very athletic 
Uh-huh 
Enjoying a th- you know uh anything dealing with sports 
Uh-huh 
uh-huh 
So and how do you feel about it 
Uh I 'm I am a person who wishes I had more time to exercise 
I I do n't feel like I I do n't very often do things for the sake of exercise 
I do n't feel well unless I am exercising 
and I try to do things that involve exercise 
but I very rarely do things like um I 've never done aerobics or any sort of structured 
this is my exercise time 
Uh-huh 
but I do lots of outdoor sports and things bicycling uh you know mountaineering a little mountaineering this and that 
and I spend a lot of time 
and I probably get more exercise than your average person 
But it 's not a a structured sort of thing 
and I have to admit I have a certain resistance to the idea of exercising for exercising 's sake 
Uh-huh 
and perhaps it 's because somehow that implies to me it 's not fun or something like that 
Yeah 
well I I 've my that 's the way my mother stands on it 
She feels like if it 's something that you have to do you know if you look at it as if you have to do it then it becomes it becomes a chore 
Uh-huh 
Uh-huh 
Yes 
yes 
and and she does n't enjoy it when it 's a chore 
So um and I feel that way too as far as you know just sitting and doing you know to the idea of doing fifty sit-ups or something you know 
to Uh-huh 
uh-huh 
you 're a calcu- you know 
calculated down 
and do your calisthenics you know three times a week 
Uh-huh 
or but but I do try and um I do try and regulate how much exercise I get a week 
Uh-huh 
uh-huh 
Yeah 
yeah 
Is that why you like aerobics classes because you 're not sort of someone else is doing the counting for you so it makes it less of a chore 
Yeah 
And it 's got and I 've always enjoyed dance 
Yeah 
So it involves you know I I ca n't get out to dance all the time
