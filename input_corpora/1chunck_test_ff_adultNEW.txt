So there 's things that invade that second type of privacy where you do know about them and possibly things that invade that second type of privacy without you knowing about it 
and I ca n't talk about the second one other than to to to generate paranoia 
It 's a surmise 
and I 'd like to think that it 's quite low at least in this country 
To to surmise It is there 
I do n't think I 'd like the is monitoring my phone or anything like that 
Well I guess although I well that 's a good point where you said that how does one define what invasion of privacy is because uh if that 's the case of a tree falling in the forest 
Uh-huh 
yeah 
and I 'm not feeling invaded then maybe my privacy has n't been because I have no sense of my privacy state having been invaded 
Uh-huh 
Uh if you 're defining it in terms of information gone even if it 's something you do n't know about it well then I guess one could assume one was invaded 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
but I do n't feel invaded by it 
Uh-huh 
I do n't have a sense of threat in general from those sorts of things 
uh-huh 
I 'm not sure why 
Uh I guess it comes from a sense of fact or facts 
and if someone finds out something about me that is true I I do n't have a sense of loss from that 
Uh-huh 
Well you must have a relatively clean conscience then 
Um the the other side of that might be if if someone found out something or surmised something that were n't true then I would feel probably more invaded in the gossipy sort of sense 
Yes 
yes 
ev- more harmed or something 
Bec- right 
because you do n't have anyway to turn it off 
Yeah 
Tho- did you hear about this Lotus data base that was being put together 
Yes 
I did 
I was just about to write a letter when I heard they canceled it 
That would be an example where my sense of threat would be high because I would find that there be cou- a good possibly that their facts were were fantasy 
Uh-huh 
uh-huh 
And then I would feel not only invaded in the sense that someone had obtained information from a that I would rather they did n't 
and that might be the sense of the spending pattern for instance that that I would have thought to be private 
Uh-huh uh-huh 
But then if it turns out to generate incorrect things that 's even worse 
so or if my call rate of of eight t- or so a week went up even higher because uh someone had had Uh-huh 
uh-huh 
They had you pegged 
Right 
And the person who had takes unsolicited phones calls and pays money and then all of a sudden you get your thirty a week because now they 're advertising you 
Yeah 
Yeah 
Right 
Exactly 
Yeah 
And um one of the problems with the Lotus data base was um that it was uncontrolled access to who would have that information 
I mean they said they would give it out to only select companies 
but um you know just like software is only given out to customers 
I mean you ca n't believe that 
Right 
Right 
It would it would be pirated 
and they would n't bother to check that carefully anyway to someone who 's offering you know full cash price for it 
Right 
I mean you know you ca n't tell it what a company really has to do with it 
and there 's something rather ominous about having virtually anyone any hacker being able to know what your income is what your spending habits are 
and you know and and that hacker just has to get in to in touch with the sneak thief 
and suddenly and then what started as an invasion of privacy can be an invasion of your actual home 
Uh-huh 
And I guess that turns out to be the basic problem with any invasion of privacy is whether or not you 're feeling threatened as a result of of it 
Yeah 
so maybe that is a a little bit of what privacy is 
Yes 
Exactly 
Uh-huh 
I also thought about it was of uh waiting to talk to you that another thing that occurred to me is there is not so much invasion of my privacy because I know how to behave such that there is n't 
But I realized I have to behave in a certain way in order to not have people invade my privacy 
If I deviate from social norms of behavior if I run up and down the street yelling or something someone 's going to invade my privacy very quickly 
Uh-huh 
And I realize that that I mean I can take that for granted 
but I used to I used to live in India 
and things are quite different there in terms of that 
There 's less of a sense of privacy 
In fact it 's said that no Indian language has a word for privacy 
certainly the language I know does n't but just says a word for loneliness 
Oh that 's interesting 
Loneliness is the closest you can come which is really quite different 
But but no concept for wanting to be private 
Yeah 
It 's it 's generally being alone is not a very desirable state at least officially 
Okay 
Um so there 's not I mean doors do n't have latches on them 
People do n't tend to knock 
you just if there 's a door closed and you open it because it 's in your way 
you people walk in out 
and as a as a westerner in India and I was often surprised and felt my sense of privacy there was quite invaded 
Oh 
That that would be That would be culturally shocking 
You know it very much is 
But on the other hand I realized I could go out on the street and act like a complete lunatic 
Uh-huh 
and people would leave me alone 
Uh-huh 
Whereas in this country where everyone respects the closed doors very much if you go out and then act like the lunatic you you violate the uh the norms of social of um public behavior 
Um people start paying attention to you very much 
and they start asking questions and in the sense are invite- invade invading your privacy although if you know what the social norms are you know quote unquote you asked for it 
But it does mean that you have yet another reason to follow a set of social norms 
Yes 
And which is n't of always the case in all cultures 
and it was n't until I was thinking about it just now that I realized that 's actually something that 's culturally relative 
Tha- that is true 
I have n't thought about that 
and and that it 's fascinating to to think a lot of someone who does n't know how to say private 
Uh-huh 
uh-huh 
And that 's really um well I mean I I wonder how people have sex and things like that 
I mean they a- you go to India 
and it 's obvious you know the results of sex are quite obvious as the population goes up an extra hundred million every few years 
Um but I I just do n't quite um there 's hope I actually for al- of the time I 've spent there I still do n't quite understand how certain things that I assume and require privacy and require not just that you be alone but actually that you have a sense of privacy 
Yes 
Because anyone can be alone for some period of time 
but for me a lot of what I do requires a sense that there 's this invisible barrier around me which people wil- will respect 
Yes 
And if that 's gone um I I really do n't know how to live very well 
and I wonder I really do wonder how people do that 
That 's interesting 
Are th- are there any other specific things that that you feel like where where you feel your privacy to be invaded on a day-to-day basis or either on a growing frequency 
All the class- the other classic examples the Jehovah 's Witness or or Mormons or someone knocking at the front door um which is more intrusive because I have to really tell someone to go away 
And there 's that sense of I have now opened my door they now see what I look like what I live like 
and nor- and they 're doing something that normally I really only invite people to 
Okay 
Because I any anyone any friend anyone I give my number to is welcome to call me 
but no one is just welcome to come by my house 
So that is more of a sense of invasion 
So that 's another example of the invasion because of the not so Have you ever gotten one of those calls that is either generated by a computer or somebody going down a list 
and they 're either offering a service 
or they 're introducing some new product in the area 
and normally when they call you 're either in the shower 
or you 're in the middle of cooking something 
and you have to stop everything to run to the phone 
Yes 
yes 
Is is that one that you 're talking about That was the big one I 'm talking about 
I work weird hours 
and invariably just about the time I 'm going to sleep the phone tears off the wall 
Uh-huh 
uh-huh 
And you are trying to crawl out of a half unconscious sleep and answer the phone 
you either hear the cli- as soon as you say hello you hear the click of the recording coming on 
Uh-huh 
or you hear somebody all ready starting reading off a list of stuff that they 've read probably a thousand times that day already 
That 's true 
or the ones that are are generated by a computer 
It 's just a computer voice that comes on the line 
Those are the ones that I really really hate too 
I 've even had some of them 
the they 're voice activated 
and you 've got to say hello twice before they 'll do anything 
Uh-huh 
uh-huh 
Yeah 
sometimes I I get them on my uh answering machine at home 
so and I hate that when I 've got a whole bunch of messages 
and I go through them 
and most of them are n't from anybody at all 
What I would love to see done to stop all of this Uh-huh 
we 've got a thing in this country 
you can have your phone number unlisted 
Uh-huh 
and I think a law should be passed to where any of these people I think it 's great that you know freedom of speech in this country and everything but if they 're going to offer these services or these recorded message everything they ought to be stuck working with the phone book like everybody else instead of using a computer to go through and just go down every sequence of numbers for this certain area code and call them 
Uh-huh 
yes 
see I have an unlisted telephone number 
but I still get all of those calls 
and then some of them are speaking in a foreign language that I do n't even understand 
So yeah 
I do 
I really feel that 's uh an invasion of my privacy 
I agree with you on that particular subject there 
Let me see 
That 's about that as far as any other everyday occurrences 
I put a stop to some of them as far as the door to door either religious groups or people peddling products 
If I wanted their products I would have either gone to the store to bought it 
or I would have called for their salesman to come out 
Uh-huh 
uh-huh 
Yeah 
that 's true 
Living in an apartment complex though you know you ca n't um you ca n't really stop those people from coming around even though they put up signs out front that says no solicitations uh 
but they still come up to the front door and uh you know walk around 
So usually what I do is I 'll call the apartment manager and tell them hey there 's people coming around you know 
and they 're trying to sell something 
or or they 're from a religious organization 
and I really hate that 
I really really do 
I had somebody come to the door about two weeks ago 
and uh gosh it was about nine o'clock at night too 
It was n't even what I would consider you know family hours 
time to you know start going to bed 
and uh and it was somebody from um oh what was it the uh Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints 
and uh I 've read a lot about uh that particular sect 
and I do n't particularly care for it 
so I especially do n't like for them to come up to my door and and try and talk to me 
Now I agree with their right to uh pursue their religion of choice in that whatever manner they want to 
but I think they should also respect the sanctity of the American home whether it be in a house or in an apartment 
I 'm on my turf 
if I want them there I 'll call for them 
otherwise I do n't want to know they exist 
Yeah 
yeah 
no 
I I agree with you there 
If they want to choose that particular religion that 's fine with me too you know as long as they do n't try and pull me in and drag me in 
And and I do n't like the way that they do it either 
and and it 's their mission that they do it 
They go door to door 
and they go out into the public 
and they actually have the uh teenagers serving two years like you would say like in an army and two years in going around and doing missionary type work 
and uh I do n't know 
I just um do n't particularly care for that at all 
And that that 's one thing that I feel really strongly about though is uh you know people coming up to my door and especially religious organizations and wanting to uh you know to try and get me to join or you know become interested in their religion 
because I have my own 
Now the part about where you said the apartment complex puts up signs that says no soliciting 
I 've even gone so far as to put that I 've got a storm door on the front of the house 
and I 've put in I do n't know how much clearer it can be 
it 's a red sign with silver letters saying no soliciting 
I should have I guess I should make another one that says religious or otherwise cause I still get Yeah 
yeah 
that 's true 
yeah 
No 
I do n't uh I do n't have I did n't go that far 
but uh yeah 
I probably could do the same thing uh you know 
I do n't have a storm door 
but I 'm sure I could rig up something 
But you know I do n't think that that would stop people 
I it 's like they see that word 
and it says go instead of stop 
Oh goodness 
I wonder if there would be some way we could get these people to do this get their names their addresses and their phone numbers 
and then reverse it 
and do well that would be technically illegal 
it would be harassment 
Oh gosh 
But I consider an invasion of my privacy a harassment in itself 
Yeah 
yeah 
Yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
that 's true 
that 's true um 
Well what else 
I believe we 've pretty much summed everything up 
I know 
but I remember you you talked about something 
you started off and said well let me think 
you talked about the telephone calls and people coming and soliciting and selling things at the door 
You said something else 
I ca n't remember what it was 
and I thought yeah 
that that kind of touched a nerve right there 
but we got uh we got to talking about the uh uh people coming to you at the front door 
I 'm drawing a blank 
Oh goodness 
okay 
is our five minutes up 
Uh pretty close to it 
Pretty close 
Well I 've enjoyed talking with you 
Well it was nice talking to you too Jim 
And take it easy now 
Okay 
thanks 
bye 
Good night 
Hello 
Hello 
Hi 
Hello 
this is Lois 
Hi 
hi 
this is Lisa 
And uh I called you know from that the the I Data Base Calling Instructions 
Uh-huh 
Yeah 
I got a call yesterday too 
This is a different subject though 
Yeah 
this is about changes in the women in the Uh-huh 
Uh there 's really a lot is n't there 
Yeah 
I think there really is 
It 's kind of an easy thing to talk about 
Oh I guess the work force would be the main would n't it 
Yeah uh 
I think you have to push one 
and then we can start recording it 
Okay 
All right 
Okay 
Are you ready now 
Yes 
Okay 
like I said I guess it would be the work force you know as far as changes in the generations 
Yes 
I know because I know when my mother was a you know going into the work force there was n't very many opportunities for her I guess 
she 's in her late forties 
You were expected to stay home and take care of the kids 
and I 've never faced that at all 
Uh no 
I think no- now you go to work when they 're six weeks old you know 
Uh-huh 
and you stay there 
And I feel like the next generation you 'll probably just work right along with your husband you know 
Yeah 
uh-huh 
I think it 's definitely gotten better 
Oh I do to much 
And it 's just going to get better 
Uh-huh 
It really is 
Because women are in every field now 
I mean I ca n't think of a field that they 're not involved in 
Oh I ca n't either not a one 
And I know at least in the medical field it seems like they 've come out with a lot further advances as far as female medications and things since women have gotten into the doctor field 
Uh-huh 
I do n't think that men really took the time to work on that sort of thing 
Yeah 
even in Washington you know there seems to be a lot more women involved 
Yeah 
Hopefully the next generation it wo n't even be an issue 
I mean people will just look at you as a person and not as a man or a woman 
Yeah 
yeah 
I think that would be the best goal 
Oh I do too 
just your qualifications 
and that would be it 
Uh-huh 
exactly 
not what color you are how old you are what you 're male or female 
That would be wonderful 
I guess it 's kind of an ideal world though huh 
Yeah 
I kind of think maybe in time that you know you 'll go by social security numbers you know 
Yeah 
and that way they ca n't say well they picked a male over a female female over a male you know 
Exactly 
or the way you look 
or the way you you know Yeah 
yeah 
your age or anything 
I think that would be a wonderful way to do it 
I do to 
just go by your social security number and then look at you qualifications that you know that you have 
Uh-huh 
and then And then if you get it you know then Uh-huh 
also with uh women in the work force they 've gotten a lot more options as far as you know what 's it called job sharing 
Uh-huh 
Like if you and another lady were to share the same full time job or Oh yeah 
As a matter of fact that 's what I 'm doing 
Is it 
Uh-huh 
it sure is 
That would be great 
It sure is 
Or a lot of women I know now and my uh one of my supervisors when she went on A to have her baby we hooked up uh uh a terminal at her house 
and she you know we could send her messages 
and and she kept in touch like that and basically just worked out of her house 
Oh 
I would just take her the actual paperwork once uh every week or two 
and that worked out great too 
Yeah 
yeah 
that is 
And that 's a real attractive option if you have the the technology for it 
Uh-huh 
All it was was you know I mean she just used a phone modem 
and she was like she was sitting in the office 
so I think that 's real nice too to come up with different options 
Do you like the job sharing 
Oh I do 
Do you 
I really do 
I think it 's great 
Do you work like half days or half weeks or Uh well like one week she 'll work three days and I 'll work two 
and the next week you know I 'll work three 
and she 'll work two 
Oh oh that 's great 
and we just share off like that 
Uh-huh 
Do you get the full benefits 
Uh-huh 
yeah 
we get the full benefits 
Oh that 's wonderful 
But we 've just really got a wonderful system that we 're working under 
Yeah 
especially with children and so many things going on that would be great 
Yeah 
It really is 
and that way we 're not really missing any thing out you know of MUMBLEx children 
Either way uh-huh 
yeah 
you have your career and your home life 
and that would be a nice way especially if you have young children 
Oh it is 
it is 
well both of ours is school age 
but we do n't want to miss any of those A -s and you know all of that 
Uh-huh 
oh no 
I think yeah 
My son 's just in day-care 
but even that they have extracurricular activities 
and the older they get the more that you 're involved in that 
Uh-huh 
I think it 's great 
I really Yeah 
and I look for more of that in the next generation 
I do too especially as women get up in management and and can be in on those decision making you know when that subject comes up they can say yes 
that would be wonderful 
Yes 
oh I do too 
Plus I bet it cuts cuts down on your absenteeism because you 've got two days off that you can do everything 
so you do n't have to you know unless you 're just really sick or the child 's sick 
Most of the time now you know it 's just the weekend 
or just forget it 
Uh-huh 
oh yeah 
I have to plan way in advance because or what I 've done is found like doctors and dentists office with extended hours 
Uh-huh 
That 's been real helpful too 
like my doctor stays open til nine in the evening 
So that 's real helpful 
so you do n't you know have to do it during office hours run out on your lunch hour 
I do n't know how many times I 've done that to do something post office or the bank or any kind of errand 
To do 
yeah 
so Uh-huh 
Well I think we 've really come a long way in that because Uh-huh 
I guess I take it for granted kind of because I just it 's always been that way 
Uh-huh 
But I know Yeah 
but I can rem- remember back growing up my mother I mean it was she always worked 
but it was n't that easy for her to just take off 
Oh no 
I can remember my mother getting in trouble if you know one of was sick 
and I know she probably did n't make hardly anything you know compared to the work that she did 
Oh yeah 
I think there is still some discrimination there where as you know men and women work in the same job 
I think men get paid more 
Oh I do too 
but I think that 's improving 
It 's such a slow process 
it 's frustrating 
but you can see that it 's wrong 
Yes 
yes 
and you just want to make it right 
but at least the wheels are moving forward 
They really are 
Yeah 
I think it 's getting better not worse 
Well I should probably get back to my job 
I know 
I know the feeling 
Call again 
Okay 
I sure will 
Bye-bye 
Okay 
bye-bye 
Hi 
Hi 
um okay 
what now uh what particularly particularly what kind of music do you like 
Well I mostly listen to popular music 
I uh listen to it all the time in in my car 
so I I tend to be one of those people who switches stations a lot because I do n't like commercials 
But uh I find myself listening to popular music 
Yeah 
and uh quite honestly I I have some little children 
and I unfortunately found myself listening to a lot of nursery rhyme music here lately 
but that 's not by my choice 
Oh really 
How about you 
Well um I do n't have that I do n't have that experience to share 
Lucky you 
I I do I do listen to a lot of you know I do I switch the stations a lot because I do n't have a cassette player in my car 
Um um Uh-huh 
Uh uh however I I do I do like a lot of different forms of music 
so I switch quite often 
Um I think I like I I 'm really particular about the type of music that I listen to 
Uh-huh 
But the uh there 's such a wide selection
