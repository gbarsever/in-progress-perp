Okay 
Uh first um I need to know uh how do you feel about uh about sending uh an elderly uh family member to a nursing home 
Well of course it 's you know it 's one of the last few things in the world you 'd ever want to do you know Unless it 's just you know really you know and uh for their uh you know for their own good 
Yes 
Yeah 
I 'd be very very careful and uh you know checking them out 
Uh our had t- place my mother in a nursing home 
She had a rather massive stroke about uh about uh eight months ago I guess 
Uh-huh 
And uh we were I was fortunate in that 
I was personally acquainted with the uh people who uh ran the nursing home in our little hometown 
Yeah 
So I was very comfortable you know in doing it when it got to the point that we had to do it 
But there 's well I had an occasion for my mother-in-law who had fell and needed to be you know could not take care of herself anymore was confined to a nursing home for a while 
that was really not a very good experience 
Uh it had to be done in a hurry 
I mean we did n't have you know like six months to check all of these places out 
And it was really not not very good uh deal 
Yeah 
We were not really happy with nursing home that we finally had 
Yeah 
Fortunately she only had to stay a few weeks 
and she was able to to return to her apartment again 
But it 's really a big uh big uh decision as to you know when to do it 
Yeah 
You know is there something else we could have done you know in checking out all the places that uh might be available 
Of course you know there 's not one on every corner especially you know smaller areas smaller towns 
Yeah 
Uh-huh 
Uh-huh 
Yeah 
Probably the hardest thing in in my family uh my grandmother she had to be put in a nursing home 
and um she had used the walker for for quite some time probably about six to nine months 
And um she had a fall 
and uh finally uh she had Parkinson 's disease 
Oh 
and it got so much that she could not take care of her house 
Right 
Then she lived in an apartment 
and uh that was even harder actually 
Uh-huh 
Uh-huh 
Because it was you know it was just a change of change of location 
and it was very disturbing for her because she had been so used to traveling 
Yes 
I mean she tr- she had she had children all across the United States 
Uh-huh 
and you know she spent nine months out of the year just visiting her children 
Right 
Uh-huh 
And um that was pretty heart-rending for her 
I can imagine 
I think when she finally came to the realization that you know no I can not I can not take care of myself 
Uh-huh 
That 's tough 
That 's tough 
Yeah 
I mean for somebody who is you know for most of their life has has uh not just merely had a farm but had ten children had a farm ran everything because her husband was away in the coal mines 
Uh-huh 
Uh-huh 
And you know facing that situation it 's it 's quite a dilemma 
Yes 
I think my mother excuse me Go ahead 
Yeah 
Well my uh my uh probably one of the biggest decisions I think that was very strengthening for our family was rather than have one child make that decision than just delegate it 
Uh-huh 
I think that they they had a great deal of um all the brothers and sisters got together 
and they actually had a conference 
That 's great 
And I mean it was just it was probably one of the most strengthening things for our family getting down together and doing that 
That 's right 
And and just the children were involved in the decision because it involved just them And you know making that decision and then finding a place 
Right 
Yeah 
and everybody had duties to perform 
Uh-huh 
You know whether it was just you know giving money or whether it was actually taking part in a lot of the decision making you know like finding a proper nursing home 
Uh-huh 
Yep 
You were very fortunate 
And they I know 
They and well they had well they had they had seen it coming 
Uh-huh 
So so I mean it I mean I I I I har- I I truly wish that if something like that were to happen that my children would do something like that for me 
Uh-huh 
Uh-huh 
Absolutely 
Unfortunately a lot of times it responsibilities like that seem to fall to you know maybe one child in the whole family you know 
Yeah 
Yeah 
Well we we And uh it 's usually not a very smooth smooth thing 
Yeah 
We were I was lucky too that I only have one brother 
Uh-huh 
And uh fortunately we agreed you know on exactly you know what we thought should be done 
My mother also was very very independent 
She had her own still had her own little house and still driving her own car at age eighty-three 
Yeah 
We were lucky in that in one respect in that after she had her stroke she was n't really you know really much aware of what was going on 
Uh-huh 
That nursing home life would not have been you know anything of her choosing 
of course she would she would not have been happy there at all 
Um 
But as it turned out the stroke took care of that concern for us 
Yeah 
Yeah 
Well with my with my grandmother I think it was it was such that uh that she did not have the problem with she was very well aware 
and her daughter came and visited her 
Uh-huh 
at least her daughter came and visited her and also her several grandchildren came and visited her every day 
Uh-huh 
Uh-huh 
That 's great 
And I think that when she passed away it was probably one of the greatest um I I I think it would be it was more of a relief for her 
Uh-huh 
Sure 
And um I mean but she was truly she was truly aware 
I mean I I I di- I do n't know how I would how I would deal if one of my parents came with with Alzheimer 's or something like that which is which is far more devastating 
Uh-huh 
That would be tough 
Yes 
Absolutely 
And um I I I think that what one thing that they were concerned probably was the fact it was n't necessarily you know like the quantity of care but the quality of care 
Uh-huh 
Yes 
That the people that worked there were very were very interested that to make it as close a home environment as possible 
Right 
Uh-huh 
Uh-huh 
Yes 
It would I think I think I think you know for myself I I see that as probably the the what everything would hinge upon 
Oh 
Is it how close is it to a home environment 
Yes 
That 's right 
That 's the that 's probably the major question 
I think that great strides are being made nowadays in in caring for the elderly you know in several in a in a whole lot of areas 
Yeah 
Yeah 
Just people are of course populations getting older 
Yeah 
You know it 's it 's interesting that that a lot the population of the United States is changing because you know uh now that so many more minorities where they have had extended families for such a long time 
Uh-huh 
Um matter of fact in the United States we used to have extended families 
Uh-huh 
It was n't 
true 
But I guess as we become more industrialized and more you know less in a rural situation we we do n't we we we choose not to deal with the extended family because we feel it 's kind of cumbersome when in reality it makes things much much easier 
Yes um 
Uh-huh 
Uh-huh 
That 's right 
Sure 
Absolutely 
And people things are scattered so much nowadays 
Uh Yeah 
Yeah 
I I I think that perhaps perhaps the extended family you know that it maybe one of the solutions to a lot of things even child care 
Yes 
You know I mean of course there there comes other issues you know whether or not any of the grandparents whether we feel like are going to be a good they 're going to be a good caretaker for our children 
Yes 
But just because they 're grandparents 
I mean they raised us after all 
Yeah 
Just because they 're grandparents that does n't automatically make them a good child carer 
Yeah 
But uh I I I think that you know we always uh I mean I 've I 've had a lot of good experiences with uh with many many people especially where they 've had uh extended family 
And I and I I kind of see that that you know perhaps you know we may need to like get close to the family environment and and get down to the values of you know Uh-huh 
I mean uh it 's money seems to be too big of an issue With with with with what 's going on today 
Oh yeah 
sure 
realistically it is 
and I I think I think that we may not that may be you know perhaps if we put money on the back burner that may that may choose to alleviate a lot of the problem 
Uh-huh 
That would certainly help 
I mean I mean we may not we may not have as high a standard of living 
Uh-huh 
but the qua- but actually have a truer standard of living 
Right 
That 's just a matter of defining priorities I guess or some priorities anyway 
Yeah 
Yeah 
Yeah 
I think you 're right 
Okay 
Well I guess that was it 
Okay 
It was good talking to you 
Okay 
Yeah 
All right 
Take care 
Hey 
Bye-bye 
Bye-bye 
Hi Cynthia 
What did you wear to work today 
Um let 's see 
What did I wear to work today 
Um actually I wore corduroy shorts with a white blouse um and flat shoes 
So can you dress pretty casually 
Um on occasion On occasion 
Yeah 
Um I do vary 
Um you know I wear suits 
I wear skirts and sweaters 
On occasion I can wear jeans 
Um how about you 
Well I um run a business out of my home 
Uh-huh 
So I tend to get up in the morning put on sweats um do whatever I want to do with the kids then whenever I have a meeting with a client I 'll put a suit on And then come home and get back into regular clothes again 
Yes 
Uh-huh 
Uh-huh 
Uh-huh 
Um you know there 's real no no real dress code where I work 
Um you see people wearing you know all different attire 
I um do n't like to wear heels that really tires me out 
I work in a big building 
Yeah 
So I predominantly wear flat shoes 
Um you know in the winter I wear sweaters 
in summer I you know I like one piece dresses short sleeves things like that 
I 've recently um tried to update my wardrobe trying to put suits together that I can interchange the jackets and the blouses and all that a lot 
Right 
Right 
That 's helped me a lot with having I can only have a a limited wardrobe since I 'm only working part-time right now 
Uh-huh 
Uh-huh 
Um but still it gives it some variety Add different blouses and scarves and belts and things like that 
Uh-huh 
Right 
right 
accessories 
uh-huh 
What about your casual wear 
Do you like to wear jeans most of the time 
Um yeah 
mostly 
I mean at home I predominantly wear sweatpants and things like that also 
Yeah 
It 's nice you can wear shorts especially on a day like today when it 's so hot 
Yeah 
well they 're um you know they 're like Ber- Dress shorts 
yeah 
they 're like black corduroy Ber- Bermuda shorts 
Yeah 
And sometimes I wear a blazer with them 
and I get really a lot of compliments on them 
Um where I work is predominantly male 
Yeah 
So you know they their attire is always the same you know Suits or slacks you know jeans whatever 
Yeah 
but And um but I 'm really the only woman I guess at work that does that 
but seems to work for me 
Yeah 
but In fact I just bought I I just got a new outfit as a gift that um it 's one of those skorts 
you know th- it 's shorts but it looks like a skirt 
Uh-huh 
So I think that 'll be good for work too 
Oh yeah 
It 'll be comfortable 
Yeah 
Yeah 
So I guess down here uh we just recently moved to Texas 
so my wardrobe has changed quite a bit 
Uh-huh 
Um we moved from Colorado where and I have a closet full of sweaters 
Uh-huh 
That Well see I live in Virginia 
You live in Virginia now 
Uh-huh 
Oh that 's interesting 
Yeah 
Yeah 
So I 'm you know like right now today was in about you know the fifties 
Uh-huh 
But um you know I I do wear a lot of sweaters and things like sweater dresses 
Yeah 
I 'd like to be able to wear those here 
Today it 's eighty-eight degrees 
Oh my 
So Uh-huh 
Needless to say my sweaters have been hung in the closet for quite a while now 
Uh-huh 
Today was uh definitely a shorts day around here 
Uh-huh 
Yeah 
we 're still pretty much you know in winter as far as that goes here 
This is pretty un- unseasonal 
but uh at least we you know it it it feels good 
it gets uh everybody does n't have cabin fever today 
It 's nice to get out and about 
Uh-huh 
Uh-huh 
I guess we 've discussed everything there is about clothing 
Okay 
Sounds good 
Okay 
It was nice talking to you 
Okay 
it was nice talking to you also 
Bye-bye 
Bye-bye 
This is Archie 
Hi Archie 
I 'm Sharon 
Have you seen 
Yeah 
I 've seen that 
that 's uh that was a really good movie 
Probably one of the best things about it was the scenery 
and uh I thought the story was pretty good too 
I I think Kevin Costner did a really good job with it 
Have you ever lived in that part of the country 
No 
I have n't 
Have you ever visited it 
Um I 've visited the Wyoming area 
I 'm not sure exactly where was filmed 
I think it was the black hills of South Dakota 
Could be 
I n- I have n't been to South Dakota 
Have have you been up to that 
Well I lived in Omaha for five winters 
Oh 
Okay 
and that rolling kind of uh Terrain 
Yeah 
Is is fairly famili- The thing that I thought was interesting was that the critics apparently it 's going to win everything 
Really 
Uh and I had been told you know you would n't notice that it was three hours long and all this kind of That 's true 
I agree with that 
Um I I noticed yesterday in the paper something said that it I think it 's been nominated for twelve awards 
and and all the critics initially said that you know it would n't go anywhere that it was just going to be a dud 
So it it has surprised everybody 
Well the interesting thing was is I had heard that 
and I I I tend to I think overreact occasionally when somebody tells me it 's that great 
And and it was the thing is it was it was a good story 
Uh-huh 
Right 
And and and I guess that 's what I really like 
Although I must admit I did look at my watch after about an hour 
Did you 
Yeah 
Have you seen 
No 
I 've heard I 've heard that 's really great though 
you have to go see that one 
And how about 
No 
Go 
You must really keep up 
I do 
I go every weekend 
I I uh those are two definite must see movies I think 
Well is n't is n't is n't that a i- is it is it a terror movie 
or is it just suspenseful 
It 's suspenseful 
I do n't think it 's very t- I mean there 's not really any uh blood and guts in it or anything like that 
It 's it 's more suspense 
Um the other one is kind of a a gory movie if if somebody 's not into that kind of stuff 
It 's it 's pretty graphic at points 
But uh I think they 're both excellent movies 
Do you do you listen to Gary Cogill 
No Huh-uh 
Is uh do you know who he is 
Yeah 
Somebody in South Carolina told me about him 
He 's a the movie critic 
Um oh you 've oh okay 
He 's a movie critic on channel eight in Dallas 
Yeah 
And he does uh he has a talk show on the I 
Anyway it 's on from seven to nine or something 
And and and people call in 
and it 's if you keep up with movies it 's kind of interesting 
There 's a certain a mount of dribble that they do 
They 've got uh they 've got a couple of kids ten or twelve years old 
and they call in 
and they review movies 
But it 's uh Oh 
he anyway he it 's interesting 
You listen to him 
and then you you go watch the movie 
In fact they had people had just seen I was listening Sunday night a little bit when I was going to pick up my daughter 
Uh-huh 
But anyway it was uh the it it 's interesting though 
the the difficulty with with is that when you make a movie like that and you produce it and then you star in it uh the question is did he did he really know it was going to be good 
or did he just do it 
I think that I think he really his heart was in it 
but I I do n't think he really knew it was going to be as big as it was 
I think it was something that he really wanted to do 
He wanted to direct it 
he wanted to to star in it 
You know he he enjoyed the story line 
and I think he just really w- he really wanted it 
And whether it whether it won all kinds of awards or whether it just was okay at the box office I think he would have been happy 
Because I think that I think he did a good job 
and and the self-satisfaction he got out of it is much greater than any awards that they can give him 
Do you know who the guy was that was playing the uh the the wagon driver 
Um 
A little piece of trivia 
You know the guy when he first headed out from the army post 
Yeah 
Who no 
I do n't know who that guy is 
He he plays on 
Oh he does 
Yes 
He 's he 's Eldon her housepainter 
As a recurring character every week 
Oh 
Can you believe that 
No 
now see I 'd I 'd a never put those two together 
That 's that 's one of those interesting pieces of trivia that somebody said did you notice that 
Huh-uh 
I thought no it 's really funny 
But I thought it it you think back 
and yeah 
it was him but with a you know with the beard and all that stuff 
Yeah 
I mean it 's uh Yeah 
real scruffy looking 
Yeah 
Real scruffy looking 
and it wa- it was really funny it 's uh that that he winds up playing in the movie 
But I thought it 's good that you know it was a lot of fun 
Yeah 
I do n't know how long this conversation is supposed to go 
but we 're at about five minutes 
I should think we 've done enough 
You think so 
I mean I have n't been watching my watch 
Um I guess 
yeah 
Does it usually cut off 
Is that what it does 
Well I do n't know 
Why do we end this thing 
It used to it used to just automatically cut off 
I think it just says hang up 
but it says when the conversation is over just say your good-byes and hang up 
So I I guess so 
Why do n't we do that 
Okay 
Good-bye Sharon 
Good talking to you Archie 
Well the first thing for me is I wonder I see a couple of different ways of talking about what privacy is um if privacy is something that disturbs your private state I mean an invasion of privacy is something that disturbs your private state 
that 's one thing 
and if privacy is something that comes into your private state and extracts information from it in other words finds something out about you that 's another 
And the first kind of invasion of the first type of privacy seemed invaded to me and very much everyday in this country 
but in the second time at least overtly uh where someone comes in and uh finds out information about you that should be private uh does not seem uh um obviously everyday 
I I think I agree with that 
I think in a good example on the typical thing that happens uh when the phone rang 
and it 's I calling 
my immediate reaction is that it 's some sort of strange phone message 
and then I realize oh no this is something I solicited 
That 's right 
so my immediate reaction was one of that sense of invasion 
but after that I realized no I I really wanted this 
and it was sort of exciting 
and so that was almost an example of s- an invasion that turns out to be not invasive 
Uh-huh 
Right 
it turned out to be uh uh an invitation 
Exactly 
Uh and at the same time I think that I receive on on the order of uh probably seven or eight a week calls of the nature where one wishes that there were a convenient way to just hang up on it 
From from personal parties or from these um phone answer phone uh commercial things 
Commercial sol- solicitations primarily 
Oh that that 's a remarkable number 
I get them rarely 
and I 'm still astounded that that one they let anyone do them and two that they have any effect in this whatsoever 
Um because I 'm usually so insulted by them I just hang up as soon as I recognize what they are 
Yeah 
I think they prey on people 's um inherent politeness on the phone even with the machine 
I find people being kind of polite and waiting for it to finish what it has to say 
and then they feel an obligation to respond even though there 's not even a person there 
And I think that 's what makes one feel invaded is the fact that there seems to be little control 
and you one 's feeling obligated because of some sense of of the way the ritual is played out 
Uh-huh 
Uh-huh 
Uh-huh 
And and uh that that then ends up being the the most common example for me 
Uh-huh 
Uh-huh 
Um I guess I 'm not typically feeling invaded in my privacy relative to this second this one that you raised 
Yeah 
And I do n't think I would have thought about that 
I think that 's a good idea on your part 
I do n't typically feel intruded on on the things uh the sense of finding out information 
Well presumably those who find out such information if they are doing it I would prefer to not to be known 
and I mean you know the classic oh I do n't know I A conspiracy theories or whatever would have such parties trying to do it without your knowledge
