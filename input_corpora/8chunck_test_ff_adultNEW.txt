And uh during that whole month and then pay it at the end of the month 
Yeah 
Yeah 
I mean I get I get at least one or two a week People t- you know sending me a credit card or calling me on the phone and I just say I do n't want it 
Uh-huh 
Right 
Because I Well I think that 's the only thing you can do is just say no and mean no and not be tempted 
Yeah 
It 's like I 'd like to know where they determine that I 'm such a good credit risk that they can go and say you get this much credit line You know 
Well i- You 've already been preapproved 
oh absolutely 
preapproved 
That 's their favorite word 
Yes 
Everybody in the country is preapproved I think 
I think so you 're right 
So Well it 's interesting uh that uh people have the generally the same view of credit cards no matter where you go 
Yeah 
Uh-huh 
Yeah 
And then some people they get so wrapped up in them that they find you know one day they find wow I did n't realize I had this much you know I 'd spent this much money 
That much stuff 
Right 
And then they ca n't meet the minimum monthly payments on it 
Well and some people use one credit card to pay for another credit card they own 
Uh-huh 
and I mean that does nothing but exacerbate the entire problem 
Yeah 
it does because you 're you know you you 're you know you 're just co- costing yourself more money because you if you ca n't make the monthly the minimum payment you 're paying interest again 
That 's right 
so That 's right 
Yeah 
so Well it 's been enjoyable talking with you 
Yeah 
It 's enjoyable talking with seeing that somebody feels the same way 
so well Right 
Well take good care 
Take care of your little ones 
You you too 
Good luck 
Uh-huh 
Bye-bye 
Bye-bye 
All righty 
Uh I 'll just hand it off to you 
and hobbies in our spare time is what we 've been selected to discuss today 
Well uh the hobbies that I pursue in my spare time are crafts 
and uh I 've been involved in making uh hat stands and uh rag dolls and uh different type hats with uh flowers and roses you know and uh that kind of thing straw hats and all that kind of stuff 
Oh 
And I enjoy it 
it 's relaxing 
And you kind of get absorbed in it 
so the time goes by you know before you realize anything is going on 
And I play the organ sometimes uh just for my own satisfaction Not for anybody else 's ears 
because I 'm not that good at it 
but I like to bang on the keyboards once in a while 
Oh really 
How about yourself 
Well oh hobbies gee whiz 
I guess I got too many hobbies 
so I never have time to deal with them 
Really 
I like photography a lot 
Oh yeah 
that 's neat 
uh I used to do that a lot 
and then I like um we have a new child that will be a year old here next week 
so I 'll take a lot of pictures of her you know and spoil them 
Oh that 's great 
uh-huh 
first one you know how that is 
And um uh I play the guitar and a banjo 
I mainly play the guitar a lot 
I play about every night 
And um I really love that 
if I had a druther if I could have if I could make it on the road I 'd like to play on like a bluegrass band or something 
because that 's I 've Oh that sounds nice 
I like bluegrass too 
yeah 
I 've done it before and when I was in hi- in high school and college and thoroughly enjoyed it 
Uh-huh 
and it 's really a a blast 
My wife hates it 
but that 's the way life is I guess 
That 's the hard part right 
Exactly 
If you can do things together that really helps a lot 
MUMBLEx yeah 
we uh she 's uh into aerobics 
and uh and we did aerobics together for about a month and a half 
Oh that 's good too 
and that went over real well 
Uh-huh 
but uh that 's about it there 
Oh it 's good 
and it 's healthy too 
Oh yeah 
yeah 
We do that too 
we have a uh a treadmill and uh a bicycle and that kind of stuff 
we try to get twenty minutes like at least three for four times a week you know 
Oh that 's great 
Yeah 
That 's great 
And we like movies 
that ki- yeah 
Yeah 
that 's uh spare time 
with a child it 's kind of stra- she 's we have uh we 're looking for a baby-sitter 
so we 've been out twice in o- in this year so far By ourselves without the child 
Uh-huh 
so it 's kind of uh become an issue you could say 
Sure 
Um hobbies 
I like messing around in your house building things and you know putting cabinets up and those kind of things um 
Oh yeah 
that 's great too 
Uh-huh 
Yeah 
we did some remodeling when we bought a house 
we built put a kitchen in and um that kind of stuff and painting and some wallpapering 
that 's fun 
It 's really kind of fun 
It is 
It really is 
Especially if your spouse will get in there with you and get dirty 
yeah 
Yeah 
exactly 
I like things that you know two people can do 
but I like the quiet of doing things away you know 
kind of gives you some space for yourself 
and that 's what I find in making the dolls and things that it gives me something that I can create 
and I like to crochet and knit 
I made some afghans and that kind of stuff 
I like doing things with my hands 
Uh-huh 
Sounds like it 
Yeah 
Do you like to cook 
Yes 
I love to cook 
Yeah 
I love to cook too 
I 'm uh Italian food 
Oh really 
Yeah 
pizzas and spaghettis and lasagnas and that kind of stuff 
Well we 're all skinny farts 
so I it so when it comes to I like to cook and eat and to have mai- mainly I guess I get to MUMBLEx Yeah 
amount of people eat and then say man this is really good Uh-huh 
Yeah 
it is 
um um but it just work in the garden work around the yard of course 
Do you do barbecues 
Yes 
we sure do 
smoke them an- Well uh uh smoking and all that stuff 
Oh yeah 
all that hoedown stuff 
Yeah 
yep 
All that stuff that 's bad for you 
I I lived in Abilene for a little while and uh worked in the Abilene plant 
Oh sure 
yeah 
and we used to go to Joe Allen 's Barbecue 
and uh oh that was great 
Oh yeah 
Really great 
That 's uh only way to do it 
they have some nice stuff down there 
I miss it 
Well yeah 
it 's uh it 's uh it 's uh there 's uh there 's pluses to everything 
Oh yeah 
but you know seems like there 's just so many things to do down here 
I like the sports 
I play a lot of racquetball 
We did MUMBLEx I did horseback riding too 
in fact when my children were growing up we always had horses 
and uh that was kind of for them 
but they were n't as interested in it as we were you know 
so uh that was a real I 'd say probably for maybe fifteen years we dabbled in that you know 
we always had horses around 
and I really enjoyed that 
Oh that 's great 
sounds like you and I was disappointed when I went to Texas 
I did n't see that many of them 
Horses 
Yes 
Yeah 
you really do n't 
Yeah 
th- the you have to look real hard to see a lot of things besides concrete uh 
I know 
I know 
it 's true 
there 's buildings and concrete and a lot of people 
and that 's about it down here 
and so Uh-huh 
Yeah 
But uh that 's great 
Well sounds like you have a lot of nice hobbies there 
Yeah 
you too 
you too 
Well great 
well look uh 
I know it 's probably late for you 
Okay 
I enjoyed speaking with you 
Me too 
have a good weekend 
Okay 
Bye-bye 
Bye now 
Okay 
I do n't know 
which end do we push 
but okay 
Okay 
well um let 's see 
I I think there 's a lot of people that do n't vote because they do n't really think their their uh opinion is going to be heard 
and you know there 's such a small voice and such a huge number of people in the United States 
and that you know their yo- vote 's not going to make that much difference 
and whether you vote for one person or the other person the issues is what you know what you believe in 
and that person is going to have a lot of uh since there 's so many issues this one person can believe a lot of different ways on all of them 
Right 
yeah 
so it would be really difficult to have that one pers- perfect person that believed exactly what you believed 
That 's true 
you know a lot of people uh uh I think the that it ends up the people that uh vote every time uh elections come around are more the the polly uh the party type followers the guys that uh you know follow the party lines you know 
and they you know just go in 
Yeah 
and if they 're Republican they vo- vote Republican every year you know 
and uh the people that are independent you know are the ones that do n't uh do n't really uh show up every year because they ca n't seem to to decide which are the good aspects and which are the bad aspects of a candidate 
Right 
yeah 
Yeah 
that 's good 
Ye- I always thought it was back when Anderson was running I was hoping that things would change and he 'd actually get elected and party politics would start going down the tubes 
but um that did n't work 
Yeah 
Yeah 
there 's uh a lot of extremes on the parties too with the you know the real uh far side of the Democrats 
they 're real liberal now and to where probably fifty or a hundred years ago um the Democrat party being liberal like they are now you know would never be thought of 
it would be the other way that the Republicans were real liberal minded as far as like uh moral standings and those kinds of things 
Uh-huh 
But Yeah 
yeah 
that 's uh and then and then people always get upset about it too because you know every year the the the politicians are the ones that are usually pushing for more people to vote 
Uh-huh 
they they each think that uh if more people vote they 'll get more votes huh 
Yeah 
I 'm always amazed at that that each candidate thinks it 's going to be the people that come out that will vote for him you know 
Yeah 
That 's that 's true 
I think in uh the Texas governor elections I think more people turned out to vote against somebody than for somebody this time 
Yeah 
well that uh MUMBLEx I know that there 's certain issues that can really motivate people because we live in a pr- pr- predominately Catholic type area 
Oh really 
and when things start uh when when abortion comes on the issues and people just get all insp- inspired you know Right 
and uh still on the other hand we 're also uh this particular community is a Catholic community 
but uh uh down in where where things are a little bit different uh you know it 's it 's women 's rights and the and that sort of movement 
and so it 's uh quite the opposite 
so elections start getting very uh the elections where they have that topic seem to be a little bit better attended than some of the other ones 
Yeah 
that 's true 
But uh Yeah 
that 's true that the different places in America that uh you know different issues would be a lot more important than say in another place 
Yeah 
I can understand why why some of the the rural areas the voter turnout is n't as much because it does seem sometimes like the lobbyists in are like controlling things for the the Midwest 
Uh-huh 
and uh it does n't matter who they put in office they 're going to fall subject to uh the pressure that the lobbyists can put 
Right 
Yeah 
and it 's uh real true that uh you know they 'll say one thing to get elected 
and then once they do get elected they do n't have the power or the authority or the willingness to do those things that they promised you know beforehand 
Right 
You know maybe it just was n't possible at all in the first place you know like the no new taxes thing 
You know that 's uh with the economy going the way it is and everything that was nearly ridiculous thing to even try to do 
Yeah 
Yeah 
Well I do n't think he 's going to have to worry about that next year 
I think he can probably raise taxes and still get elected 
Right 
Uh 
Right 
after the war 
Uh-huh 
That really uh Unfortunately that will probably even drop lower the voters turndown MUMBLEx even more because more Democrats will think that they do n't have a shot 
so they wo n't even bother turning out 
Uh that 's true 
yeah 
They 'll just say oh well you know the Republicans have this election 
we 'll see you in four years 
Right 
Yeah 
MUMBLEx hope some of the local well that 's what they they keep saying that it seems like people with old-fashioned values are the ones that are n't turning out at the at the booths 
they they say that these older voters that uh you know they they feel like the kids are running the the country 
so they they do n't come out turn out to vote 
and they 're the ones that uh you know really know what 's going on have the experience and seen you know how politicians can you know screwup or what ever 
Uh-huh 
But I know my grandmother has n't voted in years 
Right 
that 's you know neither has mine as a matter of fact 
And uh that 's true 
they I think they look at it as well everybody the majority of the people think this way when that 's not necessarily true because you know that 's what the media says 
Well the majority believes this way 
so uh they do n't even bother turning out to vote to express their uh opinions 
So that 's that 's true 
Yeah 
wonder if they 're going to take into account MUMBLEx this computerized conversation that there 's little children you know bouncing in your knee the whole time you 're talking 
Yeah 
Do you hear the dogs in the background here 
No 
I ca n't hear them 
Okay 
they 're the children next door just opened the fence 
and they went off 
Oh yeah 
Yeah 
But anyway that 's I guess we 've uh talked long enough 
and uh that was sort of interesting 
Yeah 
What part of the country are you from 
Uh Washington 
Are you really 
Uh-huh 
Wow 
This is I 'm in from this is Dallas where I 'm at 
Oh okay 
The outskirts of Dallas 
Well I figured with Texas Instruments they 'd probably have a few uh Texans on the line now and then 
Yeah 
do do you work for I in any way 
No 
huh-uh 
Wow 
how did you how did they get you 
Um they MUMBLEx they went through engineering companies 
Oh 
and uh we 're communications 
I I work in a communications company 
Oh okay 
right 
I work for I 
so we saw it on the uh News one day 
and I thought wow that might be interesting 
Yeah 
MUMBLEx sort of different 
Yeah 
They called me at uh ten o'clock one night 
that was very strange 
Yeah 
I guess they were doing MUMBLEx Eastern Standard Time 
I was like I do n't know how long it takes whether it takes five minutes or twenty minutes 
Yeah 
Central Standard Time is what they 're doing it by 
Yeah 
Yeah 
I still have n't figured out what the zero through six days which day is which yet 
but I did n't study it that hard 
so maybe I 'll figure it out 
Uh-huh 
But anyway it was nice to talk to you and uh sort of meet you 
and that was an interesting topic 
Okay 
Yeah 
Okay 
well if you 're ever in uh come look up Wayne Sherman you 'll say oh yeah talked to that guy 
Okay 
I 'm I 'm Kyle Hunt too if you ever come to to Dallas area 
MUMBLEx Oh 
Okay 
We live right by the airport 
Yeah 
yeah 
so do we 
Oh okay 
Yeah 
right next to Dulles 
Yeah 
All right I 'll talk to you later 
Okay 
Bye-bye 
Bye 
Here goes Sharon 
Okay 
Well what do you think about Nolan Ryan being the first baseball player to earn a million dollars 
That 's the only thing I found out tonight 
Oh you found that out tonight 
Yeah 
I have n't even heard that 
that 's great 
I think he deserves every penny of it 
Yeah 
But there are some others out there that I do n't believe deserve the money they 're getting 
Well is n't it funny how baseball 's getting less than like football players would 
Oh yeah 
Wonder because football And they play a lot they play a lot longer season too 
And a lot more games right 
Yeah 
that 's exactly right 
Uh-huh 
But I think let 's see 
the teams that were there last year were see somebody from California 
I do n't even know who won the pennant last year 
Beats me 
I mean I know Yankees have won a lot games through the years 
Yeah 
Not lately though 
We have been talking about this 
I tried to call earlier 
Uh-huh 
and we had made a list of all these uh baseball teams and the cities that they were from MUMBLEx 
then I started cleaning 
and I do n't even know where I even put that paper 
Threw it away 
Yeah 
I was just cleaning and throwing 
Oh gosh 
Let 's see 
The teams that I think the A 's were in it last year 
The Oakland A 's and I think it was I do n't think it was an all California baseball 
Well have you ever played baseball 
I played softball 
Well that 's what I did when I was growing up 
Yeah 
That was fun 
Yeah 
that 's fun 
That 's a whole different sport 
Uh-huh 
Yeah 
let 's see 
but I think I think the Rangers need to go 
and I think the Pirates will go 
And uh let 's see 
Rangers have got a new guy this year 
I do n't even remember his name either 
Do you ever go see the Rangers 
Every once in a while I I like to go on the nights when there 's not anybody out there not very many people out there 
It 's a lot more fun when you 're not fighting a crowd 
Yeah 
I think it 's fun 
I like just looking at the billboards 
Yeah 
sometimes when I if you go out there during the day you just fry under the sun 
Yeah 
it 's nice at night 
Yeah 
That 's when I 've been 
It is Well And do you know anything about that new stadium 
have you seen all those pictures that they 're going to put out there 
No 
Yeah 
that that huge it 's suppose to be a huge stadium 
and it 's going to have little shopping centers in it and little like a lake or something running through it 
And uh they 're going to try to make it a real community center out there 
Cou- And you 're going to be able to buy your what was no wait MUMBLEx about the liquor That 's that 's in uh Texas stadium where the football players play 
Oh yeah 
so you and they 're never going to let liquor in there 
Well they 're trying 
I know 
but they try every year 
and every year they get thrown out 
It 's so stupid because they let you take it in there 
but they do n't they do n't allow you to sell it do n't allow them to sell it there 
Uh-huh 
But uh that new stadium 's going to be real nice 
and I heard that there 's uh that you can bid on that stadium 
last night on the news I heard that they said you could you could bid on the stadium to have it named after you 
so Uh-huh 
right 
And it 's going to go to the highest bidder 
Oh Well that 's the way to do it 
Yeah 
so that could be your you know fifteen minutes of fame 
You hear that 
That 's my kids turning on their music 
MUMBLEx Oh 
Holly turn it down 
I think it 's the Bart man the Simpsons 
Oh God I stay away from them 
I wish I could 
I bet you do 
Well where are you 
In Plano 
Okay
