Oh what 's he teach 
A 
Uh-huh 
So what do you do 
I teach 
but I teach for Dallas 
Oh you do 
For right now 
I 'm trying to get out 
Is that a tough system to be in 
Uh-huh 
Real hard 
Uh-huh 
Yeah 
I would think it 
I mean it 's good because they they try new things you know 
but it 's like they 'll try something 
and then they throw it out and get something else you know 
Yeah 
and you get tired of that 
That 's typical bureaucracy though 
That 's that 's I think it 's going to be any where you go 
it 's just worse in the bigger cities than it is in the smaller ones 
Yeah 
I do n't know 
sometimes the smaller ones are just as bad 
Well but they ca n't be though 
they do n't have as much money 
Yeah 
Most of the time 
but the politics the politics gets worse in the small towns sometimes 
Oh man in Dallas you do n't even know who 's in in administration 
there 's so many of them 
You do n't even know who to payoff huh 
I mean somebody walks in the a classroom 
and you do n't know what they 're there for you know when they 're coming how long they 're going to be 
Yeah 
oh how funny 
you know it 's just MUMBLEx there they are 
and they 're writing the whole time 
No communication whatsoever 
No 
I had them walk out of my class and not say their name anything 
and I finally just got to where I go okay I 'm Debbie Moore you know may I ask who you are and what you are in my classroom for you know 
Yeah 
Because you know you never know where they are going what they 'll report 
or I know 
and they 'll tell you they 've written something down 
and you hope they 're telling you the truth 
And you never see it 
No 
huh-uh 
That 's got to be frustrating 
Oh it is 
How long you taught taught in Dallas schools 
Uh this is my eleventh year 
Ugh that 's about uh ten too many 
No 
actually it 's now my job 's good much better than a lot because I 'm Chapter One 
Yeah 
Uh-huh 
Yeah 
and all I do is teach reading all day long 
Oh 
and it 's just ten children at a time 
Oh well that 's not bad 
No 
It 's good 
and you 've got a lot of federal money too 
But has n't it changed a lot over the years 
Teaching 
Yeah 
Oh yes 
Or working in the system 
Yes 
when I first started teaching I remember I went to my MUMBLEx and I said okay I want to see a curriculum guide you know 
so I 'll know what I 'm suppose to teach 
and they go we do n't have one 
We do n't even know where one is 
Oh God 
And so I go okay I mean you just you did what you wanted to do 
How funny 
and now they tell you what to teach and how long and you know what day what period 
Yeah 
you do n't know which is you do n't know which is worse 
Yeah 
No 
I know which is worse 
Yeah 
I guess so 
Yeah 
being told what to do is worse 
Uh-huh 
So how long are we suppose to talk for 
Well you can talk for ten minutes 
but you do n't have to 
Oh you can 
Yeah 
and no 
if you talk to ten then they come ov- on and say oh you 've extended your limit 
and please say good-bye within the next five seconds 
Oh I have n't ever talked that long 
Well you know I had n't either till last night I was talking to this retired administrator from Cleveland Ohio 
Uh-huh 
and we started talking about gangs you know 
He lives in Cleveland 
Yeah 
Wow 
And everybody else that I 've talked to has been right around here 
Yeah 
But she was real interesting 
Huh 
And then tonight this woman called 
have you taken any incoming calls 
Th- yours is my second one 
Okay 
So hers was the first one I got gotten 
and uh and she was telling me all her problems you know 
and it went over ten minutes 
Did she did she did you all not talk about the topic at all 
Well yeah 
we did 
but the topic was boring I thought 
Oh 
What would you serve uh if you were having a dinner party 
Oh gosh MUMBLEx all the other the one I talked about the other night was good 
it was um about movies you know what have you seen at the movies lately and stuff like that 
Oh yeah 
I could go on and on about that 
Me too because we go all the time 
the guy I was talking to never goes 
he was boy it sounds like you 're really up on this 
I said I see at least two a week 
Ugh neat 
So that was real good to talk about that 
Have you seen like uh 
No 
You 've got to go see that 
The last one I saw was MUMBLEx 
Yeah 
we talked about that one too 
And he he said he did n't think it should have gotten all those awards he thought it was too long 
but I Oh I enjoyed it 
I did too 
I mean it was just more for my money 
Yeah 
I did n't think it was too long at all 
Uh he said after about the first hour he started looking at his watch 
Huh 
The other one you need to go see is 
Uh-huh 
And how old are your kids 
One is eight 
and one is eleven 
You probably do n't want to take them to see 
It 's it 's not it 's not too cool for kids 
They usually pick their own 
I bet they do 
You know they 've got it all figured out 
Yeah 
they want to see all the horror movies 
Well and Ninja Turtles 
Yeah 
Ninja Turtles got to have those 
But most of the time really we watch them on the video 
Oh yeah 
you brin- that 's Do n't you 
Just massive rental 
well heck that 's a lot cheaper then uh taking them out to the show 
Going to I know 
Especially if you get them for a couple of nights you do n't have to watch them all in one ni- one time 
That 's what we do especially when it 's bad weather man just plug it in 
Yeah 
Of course you have to get there early if you want to get anything decent 
I know 
It 's good when you go to Tom Thumb though 
and they 're cheap 
and nobody has got them yet 
That 's true 
Unbelievable 
That 's true 
We saw um tonight 
Uh-huh 
It was okay 
it was kind of slow 
and I felt like it kind of got chopped off at the end you know 
It just it I do n't know 
it one of those movies it 's not going to be around long 
it will be a dollar movie in no time 
Do you read 
Not very much 
no 
No 
I do n't have the patience to read 
See I do that to make myself go to sleep at night 
Yeah 
Oh my Mom and Dad read all the time 
You saw right a long time ago 
Yeah 
sure did 
Well I was reading the book 
and it 's called 
Oh really 
It was so wonderful 
And then I was um I decided well I like this author 
so I got a uh book of his short stories 
and that 's been real good 
Who is the is the author 
Do n't do n't ask me 
Oh 
The was the name of the book 
Shoeless Joe 
Was it like the movie 
Yes 
Okay 
quite a quite a bit 
But you know in the movie the guy was black 
Right 
he was n't in the book 
Huh 
that 's one difference 
There really was n't a lot of difference 
I did n't 
see I never even heard that there was a book tied in with that movie 
That 's interesting 
That was a good movie too 
Well do you think we covered baseball 
I think so 
Okay 
well have a good night 
Okay 
I 'll let you start first okay 
Okay 
We um I 'm presently living in a house uh 
first time uh we had the house built 
and so this is our our fifth year in it I guess 
and uh um it was a real excitement to uh to go out and select the house and have one made and built 
and like you wanted it we were the fourth to build out of three hundred and forty houses 
And um as we did with probably ninety-five percent of the people here in Dallas-Fort Worth we bought a Fox and Jacobs home 
and they 're good for about five years or four years 
and after that they start falling apart 
So I would uh not recommend and house for my dog to live in uh because they 're overpriced uh 
but they 're a cheap house 
If you ca n't afford something good you know 
they 're good for that 
and um you can call it a home because it 's a place to go home and keep the rain off your head 
but as far as the costs for what you 're getting uh the longevity of the house is not uh is not worth it 
How about in your case 
Well in my case my husband is not a carpenter 
but in fact he 's in electronics 
but he knew the only way we 'd ever have a new home is if he would build it 
So it took him about two and a half years 
but uh he built us a house 
it 's uh we have thirty-two hundred square feet 
and it 's a brick house 
and price-wise it was great because he did it all himself you know 
so that way he could we could kind of control in control it 
Uh-huh 
and uh we live in kind of a small town 
Uh-huh 
and I mean it 's nothing fancy you know 
it 's it 's a house 
it 's nice 
and it 's real pretty 
and we 're all comfortable in it 
Well that 's great 
that 's great 
that 's uh I 've heard I have another gentleman friend of mine who uh who had a house built 
as a matter of fact another guy is building one now 
he 's been doing it for three years 
and the city 's a little upset with him 
but I understand you save a lot of money off uh by doing that 
and uh Oh you can because that way you 're not having to pay the middle men and everybody else 
Nothing wrong with that 
You know 
uh I 'll vouch for that 
Um 
But uh of course my husband did everything except my brother 's a trim carpenter 
and he came in you know and did the inside for us 
and that helped 
That was a big savings 
And uh yes 
and uh we had to hire of course the plumbing and the brick and everything else nothing you know 
he did everything else We 've been in it six years 
Well that 's great 
uh have you been in it long 
Oh really 
well have you any plans to uh maybe uh expand or move onward 
no 
we 're well uh our kids are kind of still small now 
and we had thought before maybe a lot older we do n't need such a large house that we 'll sell it 
but he will not build a second one himself Because he says age-wise he 'll never be able to handle that again 
I see 
well First one is always a bear 
Yes 
yes 
We 're having a an architect friend of mine design a house for us 
and that can basically be be put on any lot in any state any kin- you know 
so that 's kind of we just got with him and told him what all we wanted 
Oh 
Uh-huh 
and he 's charging us about a buck a square foot to design it 
and he 's re- certified and registered 
so at least we know we 're it 's not going to fall in or something if it 's built 
Yeah 
oh 
But uh I have heard that your approach is is right 
you can actually go out and sub it if even if you do n't want to get hands on 
Uh-huh 
you can even just sub it out to concrete and those kind of things 
and and that 's kind of the plan I have 
so I 'm uh Yeah 
everyone I talk to uh I file in my little book and do other things with it MUMBLEx 
That 's great 
that 's great 
But uh like I said otherwise you know a- the expense but you know we could not have one as large as we have if you know we had n't did it ourselves 
Sure 
I can imagine 
Yeah 
I mean it 's not an Eldorado house or anything like that 
but you know it 's ours 
If you 're happy with it that 's all that counts 
That 's right 
That 's right 
That 's all 
on- you only have to uh satisfy yourself and no one else 
Ap- apparently the appraisers likes it because our taxes sure is high 
Oh that 's uh that 's uh an encouraging sign if you ever want to resell I guess 
Is n't it 
It really is 
because I I 'm always shocked at about you know what they have it appraised at 
I think oh my goodness 
MUMBLEx Well that 's great 
Well yeah 
I guess that about does it 
Okay 
and it was nice talking to you 
Nice talking with you too 
Okay 
bye-bye 
Bye 
Well the thing is is that I um since I 'm in school I do n't like basically have a monthly budget because I 'm living off my dad 
but the thing is is that um I have to keep it under control because for example you know it 's like the the beginning of the semester when you go to pay for everything everything is pretty rough 
but he controls that part 
but then whenever you know it 's like once the semester starts I 'm the one who has to control how much spending there is 
And the only thing that I I basically spend my money on is just food 
and um so What about tuition and rent 
Who takes care of that 
Well the thing is is that I live in a dorm 
Uh 
So uh what happens is you pay six hundred dollars at the beginning or even before school starts 
Yeah 
And then the tuition is also the same thing 
So the thing is is basically that I spend like maybe thirty-five forty dollars every two weeks on on groceries 
and that 's about it 
But the thing uh also is that you know like if you want to go out like if you want to go to a restaurant or something then I have to moderate that because it 's like I ca n't go eat out at a nice restaurant and spend twenty dollars um you know three times a week 
No 
you ca n't do that very often 
So I mean it 's for for us you know it 's like I I can spend I can spend that money 
but it 's not it 's not what I want to spend it on you know 
Are are you working anywhere while you are going to school 
No 
Okay 
Because um they do n't allow me to work since uh I 'm a foreign student 
Oh okay 
And so they the government does n't allow me to work 
Yeah 
so all the money comes from home 
Uh-huh 
So you got to make uh so how do you keep track of where you are in in your monthly spending 
Well the thing is is that um I ba- I basically know how much I have right 
Right 
And so the thing is is that I I can tell like uh I I get all my money out of the teller 
Yeah 
And besides see one of my biggest expenses is telephone calls since I have to call you know international 
Where do you call to 
Argentina 
Argentina 
Yeah 
Wow 
And so the bas- one of the problems is that I spend too much money on phone bills 
Yeah 
talk too long 
Well that 's they they want me to call down there every so often 
Yeah 
I mean I told my dad li- Dad listen if you want to save money I wo n't call so often you know 
he goes we want to keep in touch 
so I does n't matter about the money because we need to hear from you 
Yeah 
so you call him collect 
No 
Because it is more expensive that way 
What makes you think so 
Any any um basically the United States is the cheapest country to call out of 
Yeah 
And um because it 's considered a luxury in other countries 
Oh okay 
So you just call him direct 
and then Right 
Since it 's his money anyway you know 
Yeah 
And he gets the and you get the bill and send it to him 
No 
Um I got money to pay that too 
Okay 
So it 's basically you know it 's like it 's not too much money 
and it 's not too little money 
so I wo n't have to you know rush a letter to him or something 
Yeah 
because um he really wants me to concentrate on my studies 
Yeah 
What are you what are you studying 
I 'm doing masters in computer science and computer engineering 
And what do you think you 'll do with that 
With those degrees 
Uh-huh 
Well I can I can work up um here up to a year 
And 
And hopefully get a job after that 
You want to get into some kind of manufacturing 
or what 's the specialty that you 're looking for 
Um computer communications and data transmissions 
Oh okay 
so you want to find a uh data transmissions you 're looking for uh um long distance type stuff 
Right 
Yeah 
you know anywhere from um local area networks metropolitan area networks you know all that 
and so well you have a family right 
Yeah 
I have a wife and two children 
and um And does does your wife work 
No 
She does n't work 
she does uh well it 's kind of hard to say now days um other than taking care of the house she does a lot of sewing herself 
Oh okay 
And she gets paid for that 
so she brings some money in 
Yeah 
She is trying to start he- her own business where she does that full time Alterations and sewing Stuff for the public 
Okay 
Yeah 
and uh do that on a on a full time basis here in town 
And so and you have a monthly budget 
Well s- sort of 
We 're probably like most Am- American families I guess that we sort of have a budget in that we know how much we 've got at the end of the month 
Right 
and we know what bills have to be paid 
and uh we pay as many of those bills that can be paid with with the monthly budget 
so So you do n't have any problem in um overcharging on your credit card and stuff like that 
Oh sure 
We 're like everybody else you know 
we 've got a several credit cards that sometimes um instead of paying them all off every month maybe you have to slip some and you pay part of it this month and part of it next month especially around Christmas time 
Yeah 
yeah 
You know that 's when everybody goes crazy on charging stuff 
Well then uh see uh that 's that 's one of the points which I do n't see 
like I I do n't give a lot of gifts during Christmas 
and I you know I do n't wa- I do n't like to give any at all 
Yeah 
because the thing is is that you know it 's like if I want something I 'll I 'll ask somebody you know 
Yeah 
like like uh for Chr- uh for Christmas my roommate goes what do you want 
And I said I want a backpack 
Yeah 
You kno- no 
I told him yo- if you want to give me a present for Christmas give me a backpack 
Yeah 
that 's something that you can use 
Right 
because I I needed a backpack 
So he gave me a backpack 
and I I knew he needed an alarm clock 
Yeah 
So I bought him an alarm clock 
So the thing was that that That 's great Utilitarian 
Right 
but Necessary things no frivolous gifts 
right 
but um the thing is especially remember when I was down in Argentina it was to me it was ridiculous 
because you know you have to once a year you go out 
and you spend all this money on all these people 
and some you do n't care about you know 
it 's like That 's true 
why bother 
Yeah 
Yeah 
And so but the thing is is that um Well especially being a college student yo- your I do n't know that you need to be involved in a lot of frivolous gift giving you know 
Yeah 
that effects the budget especially around uh Christmas time 
at the end of the semester you 've got finals and lots of bills I would suspect 
Yeah 
What about when you have breaks like um Christmas or between sessions 
Well for example we had spring break now 
and I went skiing
