and Yeah 
would that we could 
Yeah 
and it 's and it 's more regulated 
I mean you 're you 're using different parts of the body 
Uh-huh 
uh-huh 
So it it is like dance 
an- and it 's structured like that 
but you have the music and someone like you said someone else is counting so it makes it easier for me 
Yeah 
Uh-huh 
And someone else is telling me okay you know let 's move this way let 's move that way instead of me having to think about it so much 
Uh-huh 
uh-huh 
Right 
You can just trust someone else to give you full exercise 
and all you do is follow along and enjoy yourself 
Yeah 
yeah 
But I 'm like you 
I also um like to participate in uh things like well we just went to the uh Myererson Symphony Run this past weekend 
and and that was a lot of fun 
and you get to meet different people and um just get out you know out and about 
Uh-huh 
uh-huh 
Uh-huh 
uh-huh 
and it 's it it 's something you can all like our we did it as a family 
so it was it was quite a lot of fun 
Uh-huh 
Uh-huh 
and biking and I I I love to swim 
so I love it when you know it 's swimming weather 
Um 
and uh Well you 're talking to someone from California where it 's often swimming weather 
Oh 
I did n't realize that 
Uh 
I 'm sorry 
Well I 'm in Texas 
I I just assumed that I had this is the first call I 've done 
Uh-huh 
and I did n't realize that they ha- were going to reach out to people from all over the country 
You would n't know that 
Oh I So it 's the it 's it 's the the act- well it 's actually it 's interesting because there are re- real regional differences 
Um in California there 's uh almost an assumption um unless you 're sort of clearly of an older generation or something you know in your sixties or something like that 
I 'm I 'm I 'm not Uh 
there 's an assumption that you do something for your physical fitness and and at least in urban California 
And maybe not I do n't know about rural California too well 
But in urban California it 's just you know for all I know aerobics started out here 
I do n't know where they actually started 
but they you know the craze really picked up big here 
and before that there was the running craze 
And they California gets you know tends to be a bit faddish 
but the remarkable thing is how well the fads catch on elsewhere 
Uh-huh 
So there must be something to some of them 
And uh Well I think people are are more inc- um um people from California seem to be more health motivated all around I mean as far as the diet and everything Uh the diet and uh just your health consciousness 
and I mean it just seems like uh a lot of those ideas generate out of California 
Uh-huh 
Not just exercise but health health related ideas 
Yeah 
And I it 's curious I do n't know why do n't know if it 's do you does California have a Well there 's a sense of it being a package 
I think There there is a sense of you know whole there 's a lot of you know you 'll get organizations like institutes for the whole health or whatever 
And uh oh the the the uni- University of California at Berkeley puts out Which is uh turned into a fairly well subscribed to uh newsletter monthly or biweekly newsletter or something like that 
Uh-huh 
and and it does n't deal with just exercise or just stress management or just diet or anything 
It it 's on fairly so- solid scientific ground 
Uh it 's just dispensed with these distinctions 
It says ever- all sorts of factors go into health and there 's no reason to talk about one rather than another so that they they combined them all together 
And uh so it 's had that orientation for quite some time 
Um there 's been some progressive medical schools out here that have taken that approach 
Uh-huh 
And um Now do you think that 's because they 've realized that for whole health that the you know you have to have that combination or that people are motivated that way so that they 've incorporated that into their program 
Boy 
Do you think the program came first or the yeah 
that there 's a I I can say there 's a correlation but I could n't say which which caused the other 
They sort of dev- you know each developed a little bit and then would feed off one another and develop a little bit more and a little bit more 
Yeah 
the more money they put into it 
Yeah 
And I can see that 
And cause I knowing from institutes of learning like that I know that they 've got to get their money somewhere 
and somebody 's got to be willing to pay for it and believe in it 
so Yeah 
yeah 
Exactly 
And part of it is California you know in back in the sixties had a lot of alternative movements 
and some of them fizzled out 
and some of them were disastrous 
and others of them um had an impact on the society around here 
And one of the ones that had an impact was uh people becoming interested in alternate practices 
I 'm not sure if it was a meditation practice or if it was you know which is similar to a stress management practice or alternates to uh A A approved medicine 
Uh you have you know major um acupuncture schools and things out here 
And and you could have them around long enough 
and more and more people start believing them or wondering how to combine them with other things 
Uh-huh 
and before long you you get this this whole kind of Gestalt this whole package of of health of health care and options 
Uh-huh 
and uh and exercise is is strongly considered one of them 
The irony is is it 's people in the cities in my experience that are most oriented towards doing the exercise 
And I guess because they spend all day in back of their desks 
The average person out on the farm at least traditionally now they drive fancy tractors as much as anything but at least traditionally the laborers Yeah 
last thing Or they 're older 
Pardon me 
Well do n't you think they tend to be older in the rural ar- I I sometimes think that it 's almost frantic effort on the part of the people in the city 
Oh like everything else 
I live in a rural area 
so you know I see that 
Yeah 
yeah 
The rat race to exercise 
It 's yeah it 's it 's like it 's frantic to you know to uh achieve something that that a person in a rural area uh almost does n't worry about it to such a degree but stays you know almost healthier you know 
Uh-huh 
Yeah 
well I I think so 
as a fit person 
I mean you you 've if you look at cert- if you look at other cultures like I know a little bit about people who were considered very healthy in China 
and they do n't do very much vigorous exercise at all 
But they do a lot of low keyed low impact low stress exercise 
and they combine it with a you know meditation or whatever Some sort of relaxation 
Uh-huh 
and they seem pretty you know they do n't have the hard body 
They do n't have that perfect look 
and an awful lot of exercise is sort of image conscious 
But they you know they live to a hundred and ten some you know 
Yeah 
And that that 's Well do n't you think a lot of that is diet too 
and a lot of that is diet 
That 's true 
Yeah 
Yeah 
I mean they eat they eat a lot of carbohydrates and not much fat Um for economical reasons not for preference 
Uh-huh 
Um Yeah 
and as we can see Well I 'm a I 'm a practicing vegetarian 
so uh I 've read a lot of information knowing that to be true 
Yeah 
am I actually What 's that 
I as am I 
Oh are you also 
Yes 
Well that 's that 's good as far as the cal- is that is that um pretty predominant as far as California do- doe- It is in the urban areas 
yes 
In the urban areas 
Most for example most restaurants in an urban area will have a little vegetarian section now 
Uh-huh 
Oh that 's wonderful 
Well most most mo- sort of modern looking restaurants will 
Yeah 
you can That 's great 
I mean we uh it 's such a chor- it 's such a trouble here 
I mean you just have to eat at home basically 
I was wondering that 
because I was actually applying for a job in Texas 
and and and uh it occurred to me Well of course in the cities yeah 
well in the cities we live close to Dallas 
Uh-huh 
so uh which you know you get uh an influx of a lot of people from all over the country 
so you 're going to have a lot of di- more choices 
Uh-huh 
uh-huh 
but but in urban areas it 's you know steak places 
Yeah 
Yeah 
an and it 's not a you know Yeah 
it 's uh it 's definitely it it 's it 's changing to a degree 
but um it 's very frustrating And even even with health food stores and stores where you can buy natural products or uh organic you know materials and foods and things 
Yeah 
Uh-huh 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
You do n't really have that 
I mean you would think All right um 
I think the topic was crime in the city 
Right 
I do not live in a city 
I live in a real small little place 
Where is that 
Uh it 's about thirty miles from Sherman 
North south east or west 
It 's north of Sherman 
Well you live almost in Oklahoma 
Not too far 
Yeah 
That 's kind of ironic because I do n't live too far from Oklahoma either 
Huh-uh 
You know where Saint Joe is 
Uh I 've been through there 
I 'm about eight miles south of it 
Okay 
Oh yeah 
I had been through Saint Joe 
but um just as far as watching the news and reading the papers and all that it sounds like the crimes in the cities are really getting bad 
Well you know I 've I 've seen those statistics and everything 
and you know what frightens me is that you put a half a million people out in the middle of the desert with high tech weaponry you know 
Huh-uh 
I mean the Iraqis did n't have a lot of high-tech weaponry 
but they had mortars and machine guns tanks and all that 
Oh yeah 
Sure 
And they did n't kill as many people in in forty-five days 
and they were intending to kill people 
Huh-uh 
I mean that was their job as they killed in Washington 
Oh I know 
I know 
I know 
Um I think nowadays people just really just murder is nothing to them you know 
Well I formulated a pretty radical theory over the last ten years I guess 
And I 've come to the conclusion and this is a pretty scary thought to me even that if a guy is convicted or a gal is convicted of a crime rather than put them in prison because prison 's proven not to work just let them go 
Say okay you 're convicted 
Huh-uh 
and just let them go 
Yeah 
and if they get convicted again well just kill them 
Yeah 
because uh most likely that will happen wo n't it that you know Well I think that the best hope to eliminate crime as we know it today is to eliminate the criminals from society 
Huh-uh 
Huh-uh 
If someone is known to have been in prison they ca n't get a job 
No 
You know 
Yeah 
They ca n't be accepted into society 
You know if they 're not going to be accepted into society then everybody 's going to become sociopathic 
Huh-uh 
And you know who 's to put the limit on it 
I mean I was watching a thing last night up in Washington State 
If you get convicted of uh sexual offenses on a regular basis You know I mean some of these guys are forty years old and got ten convictions 
Huh-uh 
And they 're still let out on the street after one or two years 
Well in Washington State if you 're a habitual sexual offender they just do n't let you out 
Um 
So you serve your prison term 
and then you go into the mental hospital 
and if you 're pronounced cured they 'll let you go 
Huh-uh 
Well they may find a cure for it 
but there is no known cure now 
Um So you 're you 're kind of thinking in other words if you get if you do something the first time that 's not real bad you know 
Hey people make mistakes 
yeah 
to go ahead and let them go 
but if they do it again and they really need to face the consequences then uh Well yeah 
use that 
or you know there 's other consequences rather than killing them you know 
you could always make them the slave of the people they committed the crime against 
Oh 
Huh-uh 
You know 
Yeah 
At least they might get some benefit in that 
and if the people they committed a crime against feel at some later date that these people have learned their lesson are are okay you know well they can free them 
Huh-uh 
But uh you know with the technology we have today you can put a collar on a guy 's leg that will knock him down if they leave the property 
I mean it will just in incapacitate them 
Huh-uh 
And you can put a collar around a guy 's leg that will prohibit them from committing any kind of prohibitive act 
Huh-uh 
But you know putting them in prison my God that does n't work 
No 
apparently not 
because look how many years they 've been doing that 
and look 
I mean yeah 
Well you look at places like Turkey 
Turkey has the death penalty for just about everything 
Huh-uh 
Huh-uh 
I mean if you get convicted of uh you know drug trafficking they just kill you 
You get convicted of uh you know heinous crimes they just kill you 
I mean there 's no two ways about it 
Huh-uh 
And uh you look at their society 
and the repeat offenders are very few 
You know and you look at our society almost everyone out on the street that has been in prison has been in prison three or four times 
Three or four times 
yeah 
I mean You know the way to stop that kind of behavior is is two-fold 
That is true 
I know 
Yeah 
One you need to make it illegal for both parents to work while the kids are under seven 
I I think that 's very important 
Oh I 'm I agree very much so on that 
I yeah 
And then if a parent has proved to be unfit for any reason take the kids away from the parents 
Huh-uh 
Yeah 
Because you know we are what we teach 
Huh-uh 
Because that 's what our society becomes 
We have We have just a bunch of people 
comes 
yeah 
and I 've and I 've I 've lived in that that environment for quite a few years when I was doing construction work 
You know and these guys they come to work every morning 
and they 're stoned to the bone 
I mean they 're so high they could fly up to the top of that building 
and they work all day 
and they go home 
and they smoke their dope and drink their booze and shoot their drugs 
and when they run out of money they go down to the corner store and pop the guy on the head and take his money 
and then they go back to work on Monday 
Huh-uh 
And the kids of these people MUMBLEx 
Sure 
they just think that 's the normal thing to do do n't they 
They 're sociopathic 
Yeah 
And I worked in a first grade classroom for one full semester 
Huh-uh 
and these kids were more foulmouthed than I 've ever been 
I had one kid threaten my life Threaten my life 
In the first grade 
Told me that daddy 's going to whoop me to death 
Oh know 
You know and they flipping me the finger and all that 
Huh-uh 
and I just said to this kid I said you got two choices kid 
you can step into mainstream society 
or you can die 
Huh-uh 
Because you will eventually be killed 
And I just I 'm just totally aghast at a what 's going on 
Oh I know 
I know um 
I work in school You know 
that 's something I do 
and I it really is I 'm like you 
astonishing what the younger ages know 
and they react to what they see at home You know 
Huh-uh 
If they see violence at home that 's what you 're going to get from the kids at school 
Exactly 
You know It really is 
and that 's kind of sad 
Well you can see it in the work place you know 
Used to be when you had a personality conflict you just you worked with it 
and you got through it 
Huh-uh 
Now you know people get fired 
or what 's even worse is they promote them into a position that they ca n't handle and let them get fired 
Yeah 
Or one thing or the other 
You look at another kind of society like the Japanese 
You put that many people on that small of a space they 've learned to live together 
Okay 
It 's in their culture 
Huh-uh 
And one of the things that 's in their culture that I really think the major corporations should pay attention to is the fact that while Japan was becoming a great power financially the people that worked for those companies worked for the same company they worked for at sixty-five as they did when they were eighteen 
Teen 
And the company took it upon itself to find a position for these people 
If they were n't fit for the job they were hired for they did n't just can them 
they made a position for them some where 
Huh-uh 
You look at Frito Lay 
My wife used to work for Frito Lay as a typist 
You know transcribing stuff into the computer 
Huh-uh 
Well she could type about one-hundred and five words per minute 
but she do n't like it 
She just does n't like to do that 
I mean she will 
Yeah 
But you know her preference is to be in an office situation where her job is Um what kind of hobbies do you have 
Um I do a lot of cross-stitching and painting when I do have spare time 
Really 
I like cross-stitch too 
Oh I love it 
I just have a hard time finding any spare time lately 
That 's my case also 
I 've got a new born 
and there 's just no time 
Uh-huh 
Have you been cross-stitching long 
Oh several years 
My husband is even interested in it now 
He likes to help me design um you know projects that are a little more customized 
Oh really 
Mine sort of he looks at the pattern 
and he says how do you get that from there to the material 
Not that hard 
Oh it 's not 
I really enjoy it 
And once you get started on it it 's just oh I just I love it 
Uh-huh 
I do a lot of my own patterns also 
Yeah 
In fact I did one you know from Glenn County that uh was a real good one to do 
Oh yeah 
It was tough 
but uh yeah 
Do you have any others 
or is this mainly cross-stitching 
Um I do mostly that um 
not very artistic really for like painting and stuff 
Oh uh-huh 
Um Yeah 
But now I do n't know 
I 'm still trying to get all the colors 
Oh really 
Yeah 
I 've got the kits to put them all in 
I do n't have them all yet certainly 
Yeah 
right 
Yeah 
Yeah 
I got to counting the other day 
and uh I think I have what was it two hundred 
and I got to thinking the money that I 've got invested in this is uh it yeah it can add up quick 
Oh yeah 
I just I just keep an inventory of what I currently have 
and then when I start a new project I go through and see if I if I you know just buy the colors that I need of what I 'm low on 
Uh-huh 
Right 
I see 
Well now can I improvise with adding and using another color instead you know what comes close Because a lot of them are similar 
Uh-huh 
Yeah 
A lot of times you can do that 
I think I the pinks there 's like forty-two different shades of pink 
Good grief 
Yeah 
there 's lots of pinks and greens 
Pinks and greens 
Yeah 
There 's lots of shades of greens 
But the colors I just love all the different colors 
Yeah 
They had quite a few new ones come out last year that they added to 
But you do n't have much spare time either 
Well not lately 
I just started a new job and trying to get acclimated there 
Oh yes 
And that does take some time 
And if we 're trying to get acclimated with the uh with having a baby 
and MUMBLEx Yeah 
How old 
He 's seven months old 
Oh yeah 
And just into everything 
so there 's not a spare moment 
Oh but I would n't trade it for the world 
I 've been trying to do some bibs for him And uh work on his Christmas stocking 
Oh yeah 
Yeah 
We missed it last year 
so hopefully this year he 'll have one 
Yeah 
Well last year he was a little bit young for having one 
Right 
He would n't have enjoyed it anyway 
MUMBLEx You would have 
but Right 
If it tasted good yeah 
All he liked was the lights this year 
so Oh yeah 
Oh well that 's neat that you like cross-stitching also 
Yeah 
that 's that 's kind of strange that we got the same call 
Yeah 
It 's a MUMBLEx call 
Oh I 'm sorry 
Go ahead 
No 
that 's okay 
Okay uh 
but yeah 
I 've been doing it for probably ten years or so 
Oh wow 
No 
I just started about well five years ago I think 
But it is peaceful 
I mean it is relaxing to do once you find the time to do it 
Uh-huh 
There 's also a couple of large projects baby afghans 
and I got one done 
and I think the other one is going The child is going to be in high school before I get finished 
On that uh Bear thing 
is it one of those afghans that I 've seen in the packages with the with the large squares 
Well yeah 
I just I bought the cloth and the pattern for it 
I did n't um I did n't buy the uh I did n't buy a kit 
Oh uh-huh 
Well I 've seen the afghans in the stores that are designed for cross-stitching 
Uh-huh 
It 's that cloth 
Oh okay 
It 's an- cloth I think 
Uh-huh 
And it has the borders and everything already
