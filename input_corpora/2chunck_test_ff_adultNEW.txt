I think I like a lot I like a little bit of a lot of different types of music 
You know I I I like music that is that I feel if it is performed correctly or if it 's done right or if the version is done right I like it 
Yeah 
but if if it 's not then I wo n't 
I I really do n't How do you feel about rap music 
Rap 
It seems to be so popular these days 
Yeah 
Well I I do n't really have anything against rap music 
I the one thing I do object to about rap music is is when it becomes militant or if it 's uh violence oriented 
Uh-huh 
Right 
I I have strong objections to that 
Um actually I listen to one time I remember this was back when even uh I would say about ten or fifteen years ago I When it was really just starting 
Yeah 
right 
when it was just starting I heard what was called talking blues which actually is rap 
Yeah 
Uh-huh 
Uh-huh 
And uh it was about the the piece of music the piece of music was about I think about forty or fifty years old 
And it was incredible I mean the parallel you know between it and rap 
Right 
And um you you listen a lot if you if you hear a lot of old gospel uh uh especially well the black gospel 
You know you will you know you can really pick it up I mean 
Yeah 
you really It seemed to be influenced by a lot of different music 
A lot of times you 'll hear songs that you know they 're not original but have been put to a rap kind of a rhythm 
Yeah 
And uh sounds it sounds so much different 
and yet I I have a much younger sister who listens to a lot of rap music 
and uh she thinks it 's pretty funny how often I know all of the words to songs that she 's listening to 
and yet she thought they were brand new original pieces 
Yeah 
Yeah 
they they do they do copy versions they do cover versions of of you know like standards I guess you could call it 
That 's right 
I think it 's kind of absurd you know the fact that you know they do n't really they do n't really give you know the original artist or the original composer the credit that is really due to them 
No 
Yeah 
I guess there was even a a bit of ruckus caused by the Hammer who 's really you know 
Yeah 
seems to be the hot one of of today 
He used um 
Do you remember that that song 
Yeah 
he used um I ca n't remember who the artist was on that 
Jimi Hendrix was the original 
Who 
Jimi Hendrix was the original 
He wrote Was it well ma- maybe it was n't that one 
Because it was a living it was a living person that I 'm I 'm thinking of that um that said You know hey that those are my words 
Okay 
And uh I guess that they because they had n't originally gotten um permission from him to use it 
Uh-huh 
And he he since then has has amended that and paid them his royalties every time the the song goes on 
but Yeah 
I do n't know 
it may have it may have been somebody else because I think I think that even Jimi Hendrix did it 
I think that was a cov- you know come to think of it I think that was a cover version of like a John Lee Hooker song or something 
Maybe so 
I I ca n't think 
I mean it was just like it was really old 
I mean I I there are a lot there are so many different songs 
I mean like the whole thing about cover versions a lot of times I mean I 've heard some songs that that I just thought were horrendous cover versions of I 'm like you know I I do n't want to listen to this Because you know you think of the original is like Yeah 
you know oh that was really great 
That was a you know a really good piece of work 
and then when you hear the cover it 's like you know God what are they doing 
Right 
They destroyed it 
I I think a good one was um there was a Peter Frampton song 
Oh yeah 
and then the cover version I think I mean I thought was absolutely it was pitiful 
I I remember seeing the video of it on 
and I thought it was hideous 
Yeah 
I did too 
It was ugh I did n't like that either 
Yeah 
but you know whatever became of Peter Frampton 
I mean there was nothing he was a phenomenon 
I me- there was no reason for him to really come into you know great stardom or anything 
I remember I saw him in a concert when I was Yeah 
Yeah 
I think I think it I think it was in high school 
Yeah 
I think that probably what did it for him was the fact that he was a good stage performer 
Uh-huh 
He was very good 
I remember I saw him in a huge stadium in uh Philadelphia 
It was in Stadium if I can remember 
Oh man 
Hundreds of thousands of people is what it seemed like 
Yeah 
I 've I graduated back in seventy-nine 
so Um um Uh-huh 
but but I 've really I I loved I mean I was I was really into the album oriented music even then 
Uh-huh 
so I was really familiar with a lot with a lot of of the A type music 
Um the album oriented like the uh James Taylor and the uh the Beatles 
Oh yeah 
and you know I mean a lot of people they go they 're better than the Beatles 
and I 'm like you know you do n't know what you 're talking about 
No 
I mean the comparison made between New Kids On The Block with the Beatles It was just You can only laugh 
Yeah 
you just sort of you know well I guess I can just humor them you know At this point 
Right 
well they I guess our age is showing when we we think that 
Yeah 
but well you know I I I 've liked a lot of the new music 
I think um um when Uh-huh 
I saw some promise you know with with a lot of the new wave when it when it came out uh back in the mid and early eighties 
Yeah 
And then um I do n't know 
music is kind of in a weird it 's in a very weird position right now 
I think that I mean I like you know things like to hear you know what they call world music Which is you know using all these natural forms of music 
and Like Paul Simon 
Like Yeah 
yeah 
Paul Simon 
Yeah 
Well you know really that 's not world music 
But what what Paul Simon 's doing I think is is is great because he 's you know I think I think that using I guess what they call it is eclectic you know drawing from a lot of different sources and making you know a synthesis of a new type of music Um 
Yeah 
What do you mean by world music 
Well world music is um a lot of the a lot of where they where they make music that they adapt to a to another kind of to another type of listener 
Uh-huh 
Uh for example let 's say you 're taking like an original Brazilian form of music and with a certain style 
and then you try to make it a little bit more listenable for let 's say another audience let 's say a North American 
Uh-huh 
And then when they hear it it it 's a really it 's another form of music and you know sort of um trying to draw out the best sources 
Um 
The the best of every type of music 
Right 
Because I mean there are some I mean I I li- there are some you know types of heavy metal that I really like 
but but I would n't I would n't say that I I completely like heavy metal 
No 
I I think you know and it 's the same way with you know world music takes the forms that have really been um I guess I you know the best example or you know the cream of the crop I guess you could say and then and then taking those those qualities and then applying in the styles that are really um that are extremely enjoyable and then taking So then it becomes a kind of music of of its own so to speak 
or uh Yeah 
yeah 
it becomes a kind of music of its own 
I mean when you listen to it it 's um uh I think that they do n't use elec- some of it it 's they use electronic and acoustic interchangeably 
Uh-huh 
so you know well a lot of the stuff you hear coming from South Africa now and from West Africa that 's considered world music because it 's not particularly using certain types of folk styles 
Right 
But they 're they 're trying to make it somewhat more modern 
I I I a good another good example was I heard Miles Davis 
and Miles Davis worked with Robbie Shoncar if you can believe it 
Uh-huh 
I mean You know he 's a jazz performer 
Uh-huh 
and then he 's playing with Robbie Shoncar who 's a very good he 's a very good arranger 
Uh arrangement to uh we 're going to have to get off 
The are they trying to MUMBLEx I do n't know 
But uh MUMBLEx We 've talked our five minutes though 
Yeah 
okay 
but I mean when I heard his album I heard it and it was just incredible 
I 've been listening to that a lot lately 
Yeah 
I I listened and I heard you know you hear this guitar 
and then you hear the muted trumpet 
I me and you never would think that they that they can actually play together 
but Oh yeah 
Okay 
so um yes 
we do keep uh well we started out keeping a budget about two years ago 
we have a computer here at the house 
Uh-huh 
and I made a Lotus spreadsheet and went through the year using all of our our checkbook to figure out what we spent each time and whether we were over or under for each month 
and then basically since then what I 've done is is keep track of it through the checkbook 
so that based on whatever we 've got coming in the check coming in then how much I 'm spending each half of the month and then trying to also spe- because our house payment is once a month 
that 's our our biggest uh expense 
so I take half of that amount out of my checkbook each with each paycheck even thought it 's really still there so that I can keep uh uh good balance a running total yeah through the month 
Uh-huh 
Uh-huh 
A running total 
Yeah 
What do you all do 
Uh we 've we 've uh taken how much we have you know write down how much we have coming in each month 
and then uh we 've at the beginning of the year we sat down and determined how much we could spend 
We sat dow- made up different accounts like you know 
we 've set a budget for each you know household expenses or food and clothing and entertainment and then our our own fun money and just stuff like that 
and then we write down each each time we spend something we write down in a book 
and at the end of the month we tally it up to see how close we you know we we try to stay within a certain budget 
so Is it is it hard to keep track of it 
or does it work out pretty well 
Um it takes some it takes some dedication to do it 
but it it works out real well 
so And and you 're staying within your budget and keep- everything is working pretty good 
Uh-huh 
Yeah 
yeah 
I stay wi- I have to stay within it 
so I you know and then we have that you know if you ca n't stay if something comes up and you ca n't stay within it then we have uh you know a budget for you know like we call our slush fund or something 
and some- an unexpected comes up then you 're not you know you do n't feel it so strapped 
You do n't have to go out and borrow it somewhere and do that 
Right 
yeah 
because we do n't you know we do n't charge anything that we ca n't pay off by the end of the month 
That 's a good choice 
we 've been trying we 're trying to uh do that this year 
We 've budgeted the money that we used to spend we were spending on a account with I and then money we were also buying stock with for that year 
we 've taken that this year and said we 're going to pay off all of our credit cards 
You 've got paper under your table 
and uh we have uh another loan with the bank 
Uh-huh 
Uh-huh 
and so we hope by the end of this year that by doing that we 'll be free and clear 
To be out of that 
Free 
Yeah 
the only thing we have it to pay off is our is a automobile loan and our house payment 
and that 's the only thing we ever That 's good to be in that kind of shape 
We try to stay out of debt 
What are you all trying to do long term 
Huh Oh it 's long term 
We just he ha- you know his retirement plan and then to and stuff like that that 's all we and you know we just have our life insurance for right now 
Uh-huh 
So we do n't have any long term you know in stocks or anything like that right now 
so Yeah 
mostly what we 're doing we 've worked we 've done the uh account with I where they we put in so much a month 
and then they or so much a pay check and then they match it 
Yeah 
that 's what we 're doing 
So that 's that 's worked out pretty good 
and then I used to work for I 
and I have when I retired from there or left I took the money I that I had in mine and put it in an I A 
and we had an out we had an existing I A 
so we have both of us have some money in an I A that we 're also trying to figure to put it we 're putting it in 's right now 
Uh-huh 
and then we 're also looking at it in possibly getting a mutual fund 
Yeah 
when ever we get enough saved we stick it in a for a while 
and then uh you know and then when if we need it we wait until it it 's expired 
and then so Yeah 
The other thing that we 've done that that was really nice to see we had one of the financial companies um 
han- uh John Hancock company came out 
and their agent did a long term analysis based on salary and uh what we were pla- what what our uh goals were on a long term budget in terms of retirement kids college paying off the house buying a different house um special thing buying land and building our own house 
Uh-huh 
and they did an analysis for us based on what we were putting in and the time frame that we wanted to look at and then gave us a good idea back you know some good information back on whether or not we were going to achieve those goals and or not and what we needed to do so that we could achieve them and the money we could put in at what time 
Uh-huh 
or not 
yeah 
Uh-huh 
That sounds interesting 
we 've never done any- we have you know just our our life insurance guy has come out you know 
and he 's set up uh you know determined how much we need to you know we need if something were to happen 
Yeah 
that that 's the other financial thing I guess that we 've done is with our life insurance is since I 'm at home now is is figuring out uh what we would need if something happened to my husband or what he would need if something happened to me 
that 's a a big thing to think about 
Right 
yeah you know 
if I would sell the you know if he something would happen to him I would n't stay in Texas 
I would uh sell the house and move back home you know to my home town 
and and uh I would n't stay here in Texas 
so you know I do n't know what he would do 
Okay 
I guess that 's most of my um financial plans right now 
Yeah 
mine too 
Is is there anything you 'd like to add 
No 
that 's about all for mine 
Well it 's been nice talking to you 
Nice talking to you too 
Bye bye 
Bye bye 
Okay 
Wonderful touch tone telephone there 
Uh what kind of books do you enjoy reading 
Uh have n't have I have a wide variety of of hobbies 
therefore my my reading pleasures are quite wide 
Um I get a charge out of uh which is uh very colorful and uh not being a native of Texas but being here eleven years have a tendency to uh find out the uh about the different areas of the co- of the of the state by reading it 
Oh 
Right 
I 've read that one too 
I only had a subscription once 
but my mother always gave me hers 
and I I really enjoyed you know all the little things that you find out about Texas 
Oh yeah 
it 's it 's uh absolutely it 's great the way that it 's broken out and you can uh set up little trips and day trips and things 
It 's pretty pretty neat 
Um oh I like photography um magazines 
I do n't take a subscription or anything like that 
Um things oh being an engineer in facilities I do read a lot of a lot of uh building magazines and and and plant engineering magazines and read up on different ways to do things and energy management type of magazines 
and and uh kind of strange because I it 's not unusual to uh see uh an engineering manual or something laying around the house 
Uh-huh 
and then I 'll sit up and read just to refresh uh you know to keep active on it 
but uh Uh-huh 
How about yourself 
Well um I have an interest in art 
so I frequently purchase and read uh books mainly on water color because that 's my big interest at the moment 
Oh that 's great 
And uh oh I guess I like a variety of things uh lots of fiction uh type books 
Uh right now I 'm occasionally reading on a book about uh the Mardi Gras in New Orleans and its history 
Uh-huh 
That 's fairly interesting 
I bet that would be rather interesting 
Uh that 's uh self improvement 
that 's that 's alwa- well that 's kind of a hobby 
but it is self improvement from the standpoint of probably relaxing uh 
Yeah 
I do n't know that I read anything strictly labeled self improvement 
How about you 
Um well I hate to yes 
I do 
We uh we have these classes we attend uh management classes 
and and they give you books 
and and the last book uh matter of fact I read was by Carl Albrecht 
It talks about uh who the customer is and being customer oriented uh which falls in line with the I culture here at Texas Instruments 
Yeah 
Uh one of its great slogans is if you 're not serving the customer you better be serving someone who is 
Uh-huh 
Uh so that 's all in self improvement to stay focused on who the customer is 
and as you probably well know all of us are our own customer 
You 're my customer I 'm your customer sort of thing 
Right 
Um every now and then I 'm loaned a tape I can stick in the uh in the car cassette set on the way home to make the drive more enjoyable talking about uh better outlooks on things and the philosophy of of Pat Hagerty and these kind of uh mind stimulating philosophy type Which all you know betters yourself 
Yeah 
Yeah 
yeah 
well uh maybe I am into some things occasionally that I do n't think of in terms of self improvement 
Uh-huh 
I mean they are 
but I do n't label it as such 
Like what for example 
Well I do n't know um 
I uh have attended some seminars that had some tapes that went with them but uh I guess not so much books although they sometimes have manuals and things 
but uh they would be things on like how to be successful and sort of talking to yourself You know ge- getting your yourself in gear to uh sort of pull yourself up by your boot straps and do what you really want to do Convincing you that you need to get on with it 
Sure 
Sure 
How about items like um which used to be a big okay 
Yes 
So those are self improvements 
Sure 
Um our supervisor uh subtly bought all of us a book called By a man man named Doctor Bittel I 
Um 
and it 's a very layman 's uh uh approach towards managing different types of people 
And the very last chapter and I have n't figured out why that one was last is how to manage engineers 
So it 's it 's ver- it 's interesting 
here again it 's it 's casual reading 
and it 's not eaten up with a lot of uh mechanical stuff 
and it 's really excellent fast reading 
and uh but as you say it 's it 's sometimes it 's difficult to to know if it 's you know I think if somebody would say hey read these ten books because these are self-improvements I would probably be turned off to them 
Yeah 
yeah 
If he casually just walked into it and uh put down a Stephen King book and I picked up one of them I might be a little more interested 
I do n't know 
I 'm not sure I could take too much of Stephen King 
That 's a little little heavy for me 
Yeah 
they 're uh quite uh they 're hard to set down because it 's so interesting 
and of course they 're all just a little spookier than the movies 
but uh it 's always they 're always challenging to get through one of them 
Yeah 
I have a hard time finishing books 
Well I guess I also have been reading uh a lot of things on uh quality improvement and that type of thing because that 's what I 'm involved in a lot at work 
Uh-huh 
In quality especially now days uh that 's almost everything that comes across the the the airways MUMBLEx 
Oh yeah 
you could almost label everything quality in some sense or other 
but uh I think sometimes the word is a little over used 
Exactly exactly right 
but Yeah we we have I think we we name drop it a little too much and and do n't fully understand what what it is we 're saying 
I think it 's just focusing in on the issue and walking your talk 
and and all that kind of rolls in together there 
Yeah 
but uh that 's just kind of part of it 
Okay 
well any other comments 
Uh not that I can think of 
Um I think I 'm under my quota a little bit 
I need to probably make a phone call or two 
Well we just started 
right 
Uh this is true 
I 've enjoyed it 
Well you too 
and uh good-bye 
Have a good day 
Good-bye 
Bye-bye 
Okay um 
I do n't know about you 
but where I am we have a like an extremely lax dress policy at work 
and it varies like every day I mean from jeans one day to business suits the next 
It 's pretty bad 
but it 's true you know 
they tend to try to be you know real lax 
and supposedly the policy is like you know we you know we hire these wonderful creative people 
and we do n't want to smush their creativity you know 
We want to go ahead and let them do what ever they want 
And you know you really will see people in in jeans one day and business suits the next 
Well I 'm kind of that way too 
I work in the legal department 
and where we are now what we 're doing is some very big lawsuits that happen to have a heck of a lot of boxes of documents 
Yeah 
And I get to toting around boxes of documents several times a day 
it always seems like I 'm doing that 
and I ca n't see getting dressed up and wearing heels and stuff when you have to carry you know boxes of documents around 
so if I 'm just going to be there working in the litigation center and doing you know odds and ends and stuff with the boxes of documents I dress down 
But if we 're going to have a meeting where we 're having the attorneys come in or people from uh other party 's attorneys and stuff then I normally dress up 
Yeah 
and I 'll wear a dress and hose and stuff 
Yeah 
you know we 're kind of that way too 
I try to I 'm the same way you are 
I kind of try to judge from day to day 
I know you know where I am we work a lot with the customers 
and we have a lot of government folks come in all the time 
and and you know if I know that they 're going to be there you know you I try to really watch it and like you say you know really dress up 
Uh-huh 
and if I know they 're not you know I I 've been doing a lot of reorganization you know the last couple of months the same way you are you know 
Uh-huh 
and it 's just MUMBLEx it 's just impossible to crawl down on the floor and dig through boxes in a dress 
That 's right 
that 's right 
It is 
and so As a matter of fact I thought I had one funny story 
when uh I was at I the first year or so we were sent out to our record retention facility to look through two thousand boxes 
We had them in the warehouse 
Uh 
and at that point it the warehouse was over across the road 
and it was n't air conditioned 
and it we were there like in the middle of the summer 
it 's unair-conditioned 
it was dusty and dirty uh 
there was like a fan at the very end of the row 
and that was it 
And so we did n't really know we were n't supposed to we thought I dress code was just dress appropriate to your job 
Uh-huh 
we wore shorts 
We did n't know that was a big no no 
Oh no 
And the supervisor from another area came up to us 
and you know this area where record retention is there 's only a few people that work there 
and he sho- he knew who worked there 
he should have realized that we were n't regulars in the warehouse there 
And he came up to us 
and he just said who 's your supervisor 
Well he called our supervisor and our supervisor and our supervisor 's supervisor 
and it went up all the way to the head of facilities complaining that we were wearing shorts 
Oh no 
He did n't at at least say to us did you know you 're not supposed to do that 
That could have alleviated a big problem 
We ended up getting called out on it 
Oh how awful 
It sounds like Mister Power Hungry 
Yeah 
You know just yesterday though I saw a girl in the spine out here at Lewisville that had on a pair of shorts 
Uh-huh 
And I do n't care 
you can call them split skirts 
and you can call them culottes all you want 
but these were shorts 
That 's all they were 
I do n't care what else you call them you know 
if they 're below the knee okay 
maybe you can call them split skirts 
If they 're above the knee they turn into shorts you know 
And these were n't even really full ones 
I mean they had a problem out here with it last summer wearing these shorts that were you know the real wide full ones you know 
and becau- these were n't even those 
These were like pretty short black 
and they were very dressy 
the were black velvet shorts 
and she had on black hose and black heels 
and she looked very very nice 
Um 
But you do n't wear shorts to work 
You know I mean MUMBLEx as far as I 'm considered she was in violation 
and nobody says anything to them 
It 's always been a big problem in Lewisville in the summertime 
Um 
You know if they just you know the management does n't ever seem to want to take an cut off you know that no 
this is wear we 're going to draw the line 
This is shorts you know 
Yeah 
And and nobody will ever kind of take control and do that you know 
Um 
so it always gets annoying because the rest of us are going well God we have a pair of those at home too 
It sure would be cool and comfortable to wear you know 
but Well I 've seen some people try to just come in like over the weekend because they want to use the TexTeller machine 
Yeah 
And they have said no 
Yeah 
and then during the week you see these women in the you know 
just because you put on a pair of hose with them does n't make them not shorts anymore you know 
Yeah 
I mean I 've never seen them do it without hose 
I mean they always have hose on 
but still it 's they 're shorts 
I do n't care what you say
