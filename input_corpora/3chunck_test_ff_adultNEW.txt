they 're shorts 
Well I think I 's dress code is pretty lax considering everything anyway you know uh 
I know I did n't know that has a very strict dress code 
I had a friend 
Oh do they really 
Oh definitely 
I had a friend who worked there for a year or so 
and they spell it out 
For men it 's particular suits uh the pin stripe and the particular colors of shirts and win- wing tipped shoes 
Oh my God 
Oh it is definitely lined out 
Women are not allowed to wear slacks 
you wear coordinated suits 
I coul- I could n't afford to work there 
And and a particular kind of shoe you know so high heel 
oh it is spelled out 
Oh no 
When I was looking at her materials when she first started you know she had her benefits package and all that kind of stuff 
Uh-huh 
And it told about the dress code 
and it said these are the color pastel shirts you may wear or white shirts with this kind of stripe in it for the men and this kind of shoe and hair just this way 
I -s says no shorts and no halters 
I know that 's it 
Yeah 
and is very particular about this hair cuts 
Wow 
I mean it was like you ca n't have you know such and such facial hair no beards you know and just really detailed 
I do n't know that that would be a good environment to work in 
I mean I see 
I I am more I do n't know about anybody else 
and a lot of bosses may say I 'm nuts 
but I am more productive when I 'm in pants 
I I am 
I work faster 
I get things done faster than when I 'm in a dress and heels you know 
I and it 's weird 
but I it 's I do I can I can get so much more done if I 'm dressed comfortable you know 
Well the the time we were there at the warehouse we felt really bad because we had uh another person coming from Washington our outside counsel 
And she was told that we were going to be in a warehouse 
but she really did n't get the idea that we were in the warehouse part of the warehouse not the office to the warehouse but the warehouse 
Right 
And she came with skirts just like she 'd be going into the office 
Yeah 
And we 'd try we 'd try to say did n't you bring any pants or anything 
We 're we 're out here in the warehouse you know 
you you got your skid of you know that wooden pallet of boxes 
Uh-huh 
and you 're going to have un- unload you skid look at the documents in the in the boxes and then repack your skid 
And she And she was so she was so hot and miserable you know in the skirt 
You ca n't do that in a skirt poor soul 
Oh yuck 
She finally tried to go buy you know a pair of pants 
but you know I mean it was just completely miserable for her 
Yeah 
that 's terrible 
that 's terrible 
gosh 
Well I do n't know 
I just figure you know yeah 
sometimes I worry about you know if I go in in pants 
and I never I never ever ever ever go in in a pair of jeans you know 
But I 'll go in in pants 
I mean today I had on a pair of you know navy blue dress slacks and and uh like a peach colored top and you know not cruddy but not a dress either 
And sometimes I wonder if stuff like that would will hold you back you know if you do n't dress in you know your dress for success business suits everyday if you know if upper management does n't notice that and remember that later on 
but you know I do n't know if they do or not 
You know I see a lot of the managers 
and they 're in jeans 
so you know Some of our people in the legal department we have um assistants to the general counsel 
and it 's funny 
because there 's one that always wears a suit 
A matter of fact he 's never seen without his jacket to the suit on buttoned 
Really wow 
And then there 's another one who 's who 's a little younger and a little more yuppish 
and he 's always kind of like in the khaki pants and you know a shirt 
Uh-huh 
and sometimes he wears the jacket to it 
Yeah 
And some of the patent attorneys have been real casual in their clothes 
and then other ones tend to always wear a suit with a very starched cotton shirt 
So that 's just Is n't that funny 
With the you know the little suspenders or something on 
so We 've we 've kind of had a variety there 
That 's great 
but I think a lot of times it 's it 's mainly who they 're going to meet with 
or they 're meeting with people that they know is going to be dressed that way then that 's how they are 
Yeah 
If they 're just going to be meeting with I -ers like to talk about a patent kind of thing and the they 're engineers that they 're talking too they dress kind of like how the engineers are dressed 
and they 're usually casual 
That 's the way to do it I mean that 's the smart way to do it 
Yeah 
It really is because you 're making you know if when they 're meeting with the engineers who they know are going to be dressed down if they come in in you know a six hundred dollar three piece suit it 's going to make the people they 're meeting with feel very uncomfortable you know 
or it would me you know 
It 's one of those slippery attorneys coming in here 
Yeah 
yeah 
look at this slick guy 
I wonder what kind of money does he make 
uh-huh 
I can see it now 
Well it was good to talk to you 
It was really enjoyable 
Yeah 
this is this is kind of a fun project 
It really is 
I 've done some of the other speech programs 
but we 've never got to talk to another person 
it was always just talking to the computer 
Oh yuck 
yeah 
So this is a little different 
Well it 's kind of enjoyable 
I 'm really looking forward to it 
Yeah 
Well thanks a lot 
Okay 
bye 
Bye-bye 
Okay um 
How has it been this week for you 
Weather-wise or otherwise 
Weather-wise 
Weather-wise 
Damp cold warm 
Oh no 
damp 
We have we have gone through what might be called the four seasons uh in the last week 
Uh-huh 
We have had highs of seventy-two lows in the twenties 
My goodness 
Well I do n't even want to tell you what ours has been like then 
It was ninety-six yesterday 
I heard about that 
and we set a record yesterday And uh very windy 
but then today the wind has dropped off and also the temperature so very cool uh 
I think right now it 's like sixty-nine 
Um 
and that 's cool for u- 
or it feels cool compared to yesterday but very pleasant 
no rain in the last month I do n't think 
The ground 's very dry 
and our yard work everything is in bloom 
so our yard work is pretty tough the ground being dry 
but I guess it also uh brings about allergies 
we 're having a lot of allergies down here right now 
Uh-huh 
Everything blooming 
and and the weather Uh-huh 
And uh I think a lot of people have contracted uh spring fever too 
so Had a lot of people out at work you know for fishing and and uh and golfing reasons and things like that 
The blue flu 
Yeah 
yeah 
the blue flu or the white collar flu depending on where you work I guess 
Yes 
Oh we have had uh as I 've said we have had variable weather Uh 
Um 
It has been untypically wet for this time of year 
Um 
and also we have a lot of green you know 
the grass has been growing 
and if you look outside you would like to go out and mow your lawn if you could go out and buy a new spark plug or something along those lines 
Uh 
but fortunately it rains 
and you uh do not have to go out and buy the spark plug you know 
Yeah 
But we 've had an unusually uh uh warm spring 
and well I guess we 're still in winter 
and uh we have had no snow 
Uh-huh 
No snow 
To speak of to speak of 
Um 
We usually average oh anywhere from six to twelve inches during the winter 
and this year as well as last year we have had less than four inches total accumulation 
Um 
So it 's been inordinately warm uh here for uh for this time of year 
Um 
So uh in that regard it 's fine 
but uh I envy you your ninety-four degrees 
Uh-huh 
I thought I heard this morning that in San Antonio it was in the nineties yesterday 
Yes 
yes 
it is 
Down in the more southern and western areas 
And of course we are um about two hours from the northern border straight south 
Yeah 
and and uh very windy 
It 's amazing to me 
because I have only lived in Dallas for three years 
and I can not believe that the wind blows all the time 
It does 
I I very seldom if any I ca n't remember you know a day that I walked out and the wind was n't blowing 
Uh-huh 
Well I spent six years in graduate school at in Indiana In the flatlands 
and it was that way every day 
Um 
Rarely a day went by when the wind was less than fifteen or twenty miles an hour Summer and winter 
Um 
so that uh you you became accustomed to it I guess 
Uh-huh 
But uh otherwise w- as I said we have had uh a relatively mild winter speaking for this area of the country 
Uh-huh 
Oh rea- where did you go to school in Indiana 
Purdue 
Purdue 
I have a brother that lives in uh uh South Bend Indiana 
Oh yes 
And I had to always I 've lived there for eight years myself 
I 'd always said I was going to go back to school and go to Notre Dame 
But I did n't Uh 
Well you are not from that area originally I can tell 
No 
originally I 'm from New Mexico 
Oh okay 
I was born in New Mexico 
and we lived in uh South Bend for eighty eight years and uh then moved to uh Tennessee actually 
Uh-huh 
And uh Well I thought I heard a little Tennessee in there somewhere 
Very much 
very much 
cause I I spent thirteen years there And uh then moved to Dallas about three years ago 
Uh-huh 
So Gee 
you 've moved almost moved around as much as I have 
Yeah uh 
my father was in the Air Force 
so Oh I see 
Uh-huh 
Well I worked for the government 
so I I moved uh much more frequently than I had intended for sixteen years 
Uh-huh 
but uh I guess the uh this is my first conversation in this uh uh series 
Oh uh-huh 
I I received a call last night because of the uh I had not received my uh personal identification number 
Right 
So I had to call Jack Godfrey today to ask him what it was because I I had to abort the call last evening because I could n't get on the line 
Yeah 
So uh is there any I 'm not sure how long we 're supposed to talk 
It 's um it 's just as long as you want to 
Oh 
I mean it 's just uh as long as you want to and just you know a reasonable lengthy conversation 
Uh do you work for Texas Instruments 
No 
I do not 
I work for 
Oh okay 
And I uh of course was I was sent a uh an application from uh from Jack 
Uh-huh 
I 've known Jack for some time 
I 'm in the speech processing business and have been for a number of years 
Oh okay 
so I was very much interested in in being a speaker for this 
Yeah 
Well actually I I work for Texas Instruments 
and uh I 'm an a I 'm an environmental engineer 
Oh I see 
and uh they just published this internally you know getting people involved 
Uh-huh 
So that that 's really strange 
I I was wondering why we had somebody from Maryland though 
I was saying God do we have a in Maryland 
or I 'm sure you have a representative somewhere in the area If just nothing more than a business representative or government services representative 
Uh-huh 
and um but I have uh I have been a speaker in other uh similar type of activities 
Uh-huh 
And I know the reason why this is why the uh this is being gathered and the program and so forth 
so I was interested as I said I was interested in being a speaker 
Uh-huh 
We have n't talked much about the weather 
Oh well I know that 's what we 're supposed to do 
Yeah 
yeah 
Well really it uh the letter just says um let 's see I ca n't I was looking at it 
I was trying to find out speedy short cuts 
and I always thought it 's not necessary to measure your time just to go ahead and enjoy the conversation and and end it when needed 
So Uh-huh 
In environmental engineering uh Uh-huh 
is that with regard to work place engineering or just you know environm- the work place environment 
or Uh well it 's actually um waste water 
Oh I see 
Taking taking care of uh I 'm actually in the air division 
and we monitor um anything that comes out of a stack or out of a building 
or um we do have customers that um their concerns are in the work place 
and we take care of that 
but MUMBLEx within our department We take care of everything Waste water uh solid waste and recycling and and air and Uh-huh 
Well I had my the the call last evening was supposed to be about uh concerning recycling in the community 
Oh uh-huh 
The call I received and so I had uh I had thought a little bit about it um before hand 
Uh-huh 
Oh uh-huh 
So I but that that 's interesting 
I have a uh uh friend who is a planner Uh a city planner 
Oh uh-huh 
And one of his and he models uh city districts and so forth uh does computer modeling 
Uh-huh 
Yeah 
And one of the uh he has inputs or gets inputs from uh an environmental engineer MUMBLEx 
Uh-huh 
Yeah 
we actually our division is corporate wide 
and we take care of just the Dallas area 
Uh-huh 
Of course we have several plants here 
but um we do air modeling also 
Oh I see 
And and yeah I take care of all the air modeling specifically for the Dallas area 
What we do we have a weather station that we get all of this information you know temperature wind speed wind direction 
and uh we have a huge chemical data base 
Well that 's interesting 
And uh our our chemical data base so that we know every chemical on site 
and and um its concentration 
and if if anything ever happened God forbid you know a building explosion or something tha- we 'd be able to track chemicals from that building with our weather station 
Okay 
so we 've got to talk about music 
Okay 
And um do you like classic rock or modern rock or which kind 
Oh I guess the stuff that was done more in the seventies because that 's Well no that 's really when I grew up 
No 
not a seventies baby 
so that 's really what I like better 
is that kind of music 
I mean Is it disco 
or is it like No 
no 
no 
not that kind of music 
but No 
more like uh rock um you know like Led Zepplin type 
Oh okay 
So so they can get like the Doors and Led Zepplin 
Right 
Yeah 
that 's cool 
Right 
And how about the Rolling Stones 
Oh sure 
sure 
I went to their concert last year when they were here 
Oh that 's when that 's when they took toured 
How about um Pink Floyd 
Sure 
yeah 
I like them 
Okay 
So so then we got we got some same things 
because Okay 
well I just did n't know that much about music 
and I was n't sure what kind of music 
No 
it 's very hard 
because see well I mean in the whole spectrum I 'd rather listen you know I listen to heavy metal or classic rock 
What what kind of heavy metal are we talking about 
What We 're talking about what they what they call hard rock 
Okay 
like give me some examples 
Like for example let 's see uh Bad Company 
what Oh well Bad Cam- Company 's not bad 
that 's not 
well they 're like for example A 
Yeah 
A 
Why 
have you heard of them 
Yes 
Okay 
And stuff like that 
That 's that 's that 's not really hard rock 
Well okay 
Okay 
I guess I did n't really consider that heavy metal 
Okay 
I mean I I think when you say heavy metal I 'm I 'm thinking about like Cinderella you know 
Well Cinderella is is hard rock heavy metal 
Well see I do n't really care for Cinderella 
But I like A 's okay 
But see for example they have see what but other bands consider it like really hard rock 
It 's like brash metal which all they do is like they have this guitar and they just bang at the guitar 
and the guitar is set like really low 
Yeah 
No 
I do n't really care for that too much I guess 
and what happens is like oh everybody gets like totally into the music 
and then they start dancing around 
Uh-huh 
and they just bump into each other 
Uh-huh 
like like they hit each other with their shoulders 
Uh-huh 
and then you knock people down 
and what you do is you also try to get up on stage and jump down on top of all these other people 
Is that the kind of music that you like 
No 
I do n't like that music 
Oh okay 
But that 's that 's what they do 
That 's that 's what some people call like really heavy metal 
Oh okay 
And see the difference I guess between hard rock and heavy metal is that the lyrics also 
Like really like heavy metal wo- is considered like the words heavy metal 
and like you always thought about like suicide And killing people and stuff like that 
Yeah 
And just hard rock has they they do n't talk about that 
they just talk about like life in general 
Right 
Like Queen 's Reich if you ever heard of them 
Oh sure 
Of course 
Yeah 
Que- you you 're talking Queen 
is that what you said 
Okay 
well no 
I said Queen 's Reich 
but but oh but you got to like Queen also 
Oh oh oh okay 
Right 
So because Well sure 
because Queen was real popular when I was growing up 
Yeah 
especially uh oh God what is it A Night At The Opera 
Do n't they have a no 
let 's see the one that they have the the whole opera singing in the background 
Oh 
Um uh Right 
Bo Bo Bohemian Rhapsody 
right 
yeah 
yeah 
Yeah 
that that was great 
I heard that the other day on the radio 
and I pumped it up 
Because I mean I just love that song 
Yeah 
that that was a real good one 
Yeah 
but they had that that whole record was pretty good 
But then they started going downhill like everybody else 
Well that 's true 
They came up with some pretty weird stuff after that 
Yeah 
they 're they 're still around 
they 've got a ne- new out 
but I I would n't buy it 
Because see what happens is the old see whe- I like I like the old Rolling Stones 
I do n't like the new stuff 
Of the Stones 
Yeah 
Yeah 
I agree 
That 's the ne- the older stuff is the best of it 
The the new stuff 's kind of more like today 's rock and roll which I do n't really care for today 's rock and roll too much 
Yeah 
Well for example I used to like old Phil Collins 
Right 
An old Genesis 
Yes 
definitely 
I agree 
And and then what happened was that Phil Collins said hey I can make money a lot of money doing this 
and then he came out with uh see for example his his record like No Jacket Required 
Uh-huh 
That was good 
but it was on his way of going downhill 
because he said I can make a lot of money just singing alone 
and then he came out with the Invisible Touch with uh Genesis 
and that really like now I hate Phil Collins 
I ca n't stand him 
Right 
Because I look at him 
and I say you know you were singing at this time and with these people 
and you were great 
and now you 're singing all this stuff that does n't matter what you what you sing or what you record 
it 's still going to be a number one hit 
And so that 's that 's what gets me mad 
Yeah 
But did did you go see that new Doors movie 
No 
not yet 
I guess I 've been con- kind of considering it 
Have you seen it yet 
Yeah 
I saw it when it opened 
Was it really good 
Yeah 
Well it it 's you know it 's like I was watching Siskel and Ebert you know like those guys that criticize movies 
Uh-huh 
Right 
And they both loved the movie right 
Uh-huh 
They said the music 's great 
it took me back to the sixties and stuff like that 
Uh-huh
