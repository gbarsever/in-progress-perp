Okay 
Uh first um I need to know uh how do you feel about uh about sending uh an elderly uh family member to a nursing home 
Well of course it 's you know it 's one of the last few things in the world you 'd ever want to do you know Unless it 's just you know really you know and uh for their uh you know for their own good 
Yes 
Yeah 
I 'd be very very careful and uh you know checking them out 
Uh our had t- place my mother in a nursing home 
She had a rather massive stroke about uh about uh eight months ago I guess 
Uh-huh 
And uh we were I was fortunate in that 
I was personally acquainted with the uh people who uh ran the nursing home in our little hometown 
Yeah 
So I was very comfortable you know in doing it when it got to the point that we had to do it 
But there 's well I had an occasion for my mother-in-law who had fell and needed to be you know could not take care of herself anymore was confined to a nursing home for a while 
that was really not a very good experience 
Uh it had to be done in a hurry 
I mean we did n't have you know like six months to check all of these places out 
And it was really not not very good uh deal 
Yeah 
We were not really happy with nursing home that we finally had 
Yeah 
Fortunately she only had to stay a few weeks 
and she was able to to return to her apartment again 
But it 's really a big uh big uh decision as to you know when to do it 
Yeah 
You know is there something else we could have done you know in checking out all the places that uh might be available 
Of course you know there 's not one on every corner especially you know smaller areas smaller towns 
Yeah 
Uh-huh 
Uh-huh 
Yeah 
Probably the hardest thing in in my family uh my grandmother she had to be put in a nursing home 
and um she had used the walker for for quite some time probably about six to nine months 
And um she had a fall 
and uh finally uh she had Parkinson 's disease 
Oh 
and it got so much that she could not take care of her house 
Right 
Then she lived in an apartment 
and uh that was even harder actually 
Uh-huh 
Uh-huh 
Because it was you know it was just a change of change of location 
and it was very disturbing for her because she had been so used to traveling 
Yes 
I mean she tr- she had she had children all across the United States 
Uh-huh 
and you know she spent nine months out of the year just visiting her children 
Right 
Uh-huh 
And um that was pretty heart-rending for her 
I can imagine 
I think when she finally came to the realization that you know no I can not I can not take care of myself 
Uh-huh 
That 's tough 
That 's tough 
Yeah 
I mean for somebody who is you know for most of their life has has uh not just merely had a farm but had ten children had a farm ran everything because her husband was away in the coal mines 
Uh-huh 
Uh-huh 
And you know facing that situation it 's it 's quite a dilemma 
Yes 
I think my mother excuse me Go ahead 
Yeah 
Well my uh my uh probably one of the biggest decisions I think that was very strengthening for our family was rather than have one child make that decision than just delegate it 
Uh-huh 
I think that they they had a great deal of um all the brothers and sisters got together 
and they actually had a conference 
That 's great 
And I mean it was just it was probably one of the most strengthening things for our family getting down together and doing that 
That 's right 
And and just the children were involved in the decision because it involved just them And you know making that decision and then finding a place 
Right 
Yeah 
and everybody had duties to perform 
Uh-huh 
You know whether it was just you know giving money or whether it was actually taking part in a lot of the decision making you know like finding a proper nursing home 
Uh-huh 
Yep 
You were very fortunate 
And they I know 
They and well they had well they had they had seen it coming 
Uh-huh 
So so I mean it I mean I I I I har- I I truly wish that if something like that were to happen that my children would do something like that for me 
Uh-huh 
Uh-huh 
Absolutely 
Unfortunately a lot of times it responsibilities like that seem to fall to you know maybe one child in the whole family you know 
Yeah 
Yeah 
Well we we And uh it 's usually not a very smooth smooth thing 
Yeah 
We were I was lucky too that I only have one brother 
Uh-huh 
And uh fortunately we agreed you know on exactly you know what we thought should be done 
My mother also was very very independent 
She had her own still had her own little house and still driving her own car at age eighty-three 
Yeah 
We were lucky in that in one respect in that after she had her stroke she was n't really you know really much aware of what was going on 
Uh-huh 
That nursing home life would not have been you know anything of her choosing 
of course she would she would not have been happy there at all 
Um 
But as it turned out the stroke took care of that concern for us 
Yeah 
Yeah 
Well with my with my grandmother I think it was it was such that uh that she did not have the problem with she was very well aware 
and her daughter came and visited her 
Uh-huh 
at least her daughter came and visited her and also her several grandchildren came and visited her every day 
Uh-huh 
Uh-huh 
That 's great 
And I think that when she passed away it was probably one of the greatest um I I I think it would be it was more of a relief for her 
Uh-huh 
Sure 
And um I mean but she was truly she was truly aware 
I mean I I I di- I do n't know how I would how I would deal if one of my parents came with with Alzheimer 's or something like that which is which is far more devastating 
Uh-huh 
That would be tough 
Yes 
Absolutely 
And um I I I think that what one thing that they were concerned probably was the fact it was n't necessarily you know like the quantity of care but the quality of care 
Uh-huh 
Yes 
That the people that worked there were very were very interested that to make it as close a home environment as possible 
Right 
Uh-huh 
Uh-huh 
Yes 
It would I think I think I think you know for myself I I see that as probably the the what everything would hinge upon 
Oh 
Is it how close is it to a home environment 
Yes 
That 's right 
That 's the that 's probably the major question 
I think that great strides are being made nowadays in in caring for the elderly you know in several in a in a whole lot of areas 
Yeah 
Yeah 
Just people are of course populations getting older 
Yeah 
You know it 's it 's interesting that that a lot the population of the United States is changing because you know uh now that so many more minorities where they have had extended families for such a long time 
Uh-huh 
Um matter of fact in the United States we used to have extended families 
Uh-huh 
It was n't 
true 
But I guess as we become more industrialized and more you know less in a rural situation we we do n't we we we choose not to deal with the extended family because we feel it 's kind of cumbersome when in reality it makes things much much easier 
Yes um 
Uh-huh 
Uh-huh 
That 's right 
Sure 
Absolutely 
And people things are scattered so much nowadays 
Uh Yeah 
Yeah 
I I I think that perhaps perhaps the extended family you know that it maybe one of the solutions to a lot of things even child care 
Yes 
You know I mean of course there there comes other issues you know whether or not any of the grandparents whether we feel like are going to be a good they 're going to be a good caretaker for our children 
Yes 
But just because they 're grandparents 
I mean they raised us after all 
Yeah 
Just because they 're grandparents that does n't automatically make them a good child carer 
Yeah 
But uh I I I think that you know we always uh I mean I 've I 've had a lot of good experiences with uh with many many people especially where they 've had uh extended family 
And I and I I kind of see that that you know perhaps you know we may need to like get close to the family environment and and get down to the values of you know Uh-huh 
I mean uh it 's money seems to be too big of an issue With with with with what 's going on today 
Oh yeah 
sure 
realistically it is 
and I I think I think that we may not that may be you know perhaps if we put money on the back burner that may that may choose to alleviate a lot of the problem 
Uh-huh 
That would certainly help 
I mean I mean we may not we may not have as high a standard of living 
Uh-huh 
but the qua- but actually have a truer standard of living 
Right 
That 's just a matter of defining priorities I guess or some priorities anyway 
Yeah 
Yeah 
Yeah 
I think you 're right 
Okay 
Well I guess that was it 
Okay 
It was good talking to you 
Okay 
Yeah 
All right 
Take care 
Hey 
Bye-bye 
Bye-bye 
Hi Cynthia 
What did you wear to work today 
Um let 's see 
What did I wear to work today 
Um actually I wore corduroy shorts with a white blouse um and flat shoes 
So can you dress pretty casually 
Um on occasion On occasion 
Yeah 
Um I do vary 
Um you know I wear suits 
I wear skirts and sweaters 
On occasion I can wear jeans 
Um how about you 
Well I um run a business out of my home 
Uh-huh 
So I tend to get up in the morning put on sweats um do whatever I want to do with the kids then whenever I have a meeting with a client I 'll put a suit on And then come home and get back into regular clothes again 
Yes 
Uh-huh 
Uh-huh 
Uh-huh 
Um you know there 's real no no real dress code where I work 
Um you see people wearing you know all different attire 
I um do n't like to wear heels that really tires me out 
I work in a big building 
Yeah 
So I predominantly wear flat shoes 
Um you know in the winter I wear sweaters 
in summer I you know I like one piece dresses short sleeves things like that 
I 've recently um tried to update my wardrobe trying to put suits together that I can interchange the jackets and the blouses and all that a lot 
Right 
Right 
That 's helped me a lot with having I can only have a a limited wardrobe since I 'm only working part-time right now 
Uh-huh 
Uh-huh 
Um but still it gives it some variety Add different blouses and scarves and belts and things like that 
Uh-huh 
Right 
right 
accessories 
uh-huh 
What about your casual wear 
Do you like to wear jeans most of the time 
Um yeah 
mostly 
I mean at home I predominantly wear sweatpants and things like that also 
Yeah 
It 's nice you can wear shorts especially on a day like today when it 's so hot 
Yeah 
well they 're um you know they 're like Ber- Dress shorts 
yeah 
they 're like black corduroy Ber- Bermuda shorts 
Yeah 
And sometimes I wear a blazer with them 
and I get really a lot of compliments on them 
Um where I work is predominantly male 
Yeah 
So you know they their attire is always the same you know Suits or slacks you know jeans whatever 
Yeah 
but And um but I 'm really the only woman I guess at work that does that 
but seems to work for me 
Yeah 
but In fact I just bought I I just got a new outfit as a gift that um it 's one of those skorts 
you know th- it 's shorts but it looks like a skirt 
Uh-huh 
So I think that 'll be good for work too 
Oh yeah 
It 'll be comfortable 
Yeah 
Yeah 
So I guess down here uh we just recently moved to Texas 
so my wardrobe has changed quite a bit 
Uh-huh 
Um we moved from Colorado where and I have a closet full of sweaters 
Uh-huh 
That Well see I live in Virginia 
You live in Virginia now 
Uh-huh 
Oh that 's interesting 
Yeah 
Yeah 
So I 'm you know like right now today was in about you know the fifties 
Uh-huh 
But um you know I I do wear a lot of sweaters and things like sweater dresses 
Yeah 
I 'd like to be able to wear those here 
Today it 's eighty-eight degrees 
Oh my 
So Uh-huh 
Needless to say my sweaters have been hung in the closet for quite a while now 
Uh-huh 
Today was uh definitely a shorts day around here 
Uh-huh 
Yeah 
we 're still pretty much you know in winter as far as that goes here 
This is pretty un- unseasonal 
but uh at least we you know it it it feels good 
it gets uh everybody does n't have cabin fever today 
It 's nice to get out and about 
Uh-huh 
Uh-huh 
I guess we 've discussed everything there is about clothing 
Okay 
Sounds good 
Okay 
It was nice talking to you 
Okay 
it was nice talking to you also 
Bye-bye 
Bye-bye 
This is Archie 
Hi Archie 
I 'm Sharon 
Have you seen 
Yeah 
I 've seen that 
that 's uh that was a really good movie 
Probably one of the best things about it was the scenery 
and uh I thought the story was pretty good too 
I I think Kevin Costner did a really good job with it 
Have you ever lived in that part of the country 
No 
I have n't 
Have you ever visited it 
Um I 've visited the Wyoming area 
I 'm not sure exactly where was filmed 
I think it was the black hills of South Dakota 
Could be 
I n- I have n't been to South Dakota 
Have have you been up to that 
Well I lived in Omaha for five winters 
Oh 
Okay 
and that rolling kind of uh Terrain 
Yeah 
Is is fairly famili- The thing that I thought was interesting was that the critics apparently it 's going to win everything 
Really 
Uh and I had been told you know you would n't notice that it was three hours long and all this kind of That 's true 
I agree with that 
Um I I noticed yesterday in the paper something said that it I think it 's been nominated for twelve awards 
and and all the critics initially said that you know it would n't go anywhere that it was just going to be a dud 
So it it has surprised everybody 
Well the interesting thing was is I had heard that 
and I I I tend to I think overreact occasionally when somebody tells me it 's that great 
And and it was the thing is it was it was a good story 
Uh-huh 
Right 
And and and I guess that 's what I really like 
Although I must admit I did look at my watch after about an hour 
Did you 
Yeah 
Have you seen 
No 
I 've heard I 've heard that 's really great though 
you have to go see that one 
And how about 
No 
Go 
You must really keep up 
I do 
I go every weekend 
I I uh those are two definite must see movies I think 
Well is n't is n't is n't that a i- is it is it a terror movie 
or is it just suspenseful 
It 's suspenseful 
I do n't think it 's very t- I mean there 's not really any uh blood and guts in it or anything like that 
It 's it 's more suspense 
Um the other one is kind of a a gory movie if if somebody 's not into that kind of stuff 
It 's it 's pretty graphic at points 
But uh I think they 're both excellent movies 
Do you do you listen to Gary Cogill 
No Huh-uh 
Is uh do you know who he is 
Yeah 
Somebody in South Carolina told me about him 
He 's a the movie critic 
Um oh you 've oh okay 
He 's a movie critic on channel eight in Dallas 
Yeah 
And he does uh he has a talk show on the I 
Anyway it 's on from seven to nine or something 
And and and people call in 
and it 's if you keep up with movies it 's kind of interesting 
There 's a certain a mount of dribble that they do 
They 've got uh they 've got a couple of kids ten or twelve years old 
and they call in 
and they review movies 
But it 's uh Oh 
he anyway he it 's interesting 
You listen to him 
and then you you go watch the movie 
In fact they had people had just seen I was listening Sunday night a little bit when I was going to pick up my daughter 
Uh-huh 
But anyway it was uh the it it 's interesting though 
the the difficulty with with is that when you make a movie like that and you produce it and then you star in it uh the question is did he did he really know it was going to be good 
or did he just do it 
I think that I think he really his heart was in it 
but I I do n't think he really knew it was going to be as big as it was 
I think it was something that he really wanted to do 
He wanted to direct it 
he wanted to to star in it 
You know he he enjoyed the story line 
and I think he just really w- he really wanted it 
And whether it whether it won all kinds of awards or whether it just was okay at the box office I think he would have been happy 
Because I think that I think he did a good job 
and and the self-satisfaction he got out of it is much greater than any awards that they can give him 
Do you know who the guy was that was playing the uh the the wagon driver 
Um 
A little piece of trivia 
You know the guy when he first headed out from the army post 
Yeah 
Who no 
I do n't know who that guy is 
He he plays on 
Oh he does 
Yes 
He 's he 's Eldon her housepainter 
As a recurring character every week 
Oh 
Can you believe that 
No 
now see I 'd I 'd a never put those two together 
That 's that 's one of those interesting pieces of trivia that somebody said did you notice that 
Huh-uh 
I thought no it 's really funny 
But I thought it it you think back 
and yeah 
it was him but with a you know with the beard and all that stuff 
Yeah 
I mean it 's uh Yeah 
real scruffy looking 
Yeah 
Real scruffy looking 
and it wa- it was really funny it 's uh that that he winds up playing in the movie 
But I thought it 's good that you know it was a lot of fun 
Yeah 
I do n't know how long this conversation is supposed to go 
but we 're at about five minutes 
I should think we 've done enough 
You think so 
I mean I have n't been watching my watch 
Um I guess 
yeah 
Does it usually cut off 
Is that what it does 
Well I do n't know 
Why do we end this thing 
It used to it used to just automatically cut off 
I think it just says hang up 
but it says when the conversation is over just say your good-byes and hang up 
So I I guess so 
Why do n't we do that 
Okay 
Good-bye Sharon 
Good talking to you Archie 
Well the first thing for me is I wonder I see a couple of different ways of talking about what privacy is um if privacy is something that disturbs your private state I mean an invasion of privacy is something that disturbs your private state 
that 's one thing 
and if privacy is something that comes into your private state and extracts information from it in other words finds something out about you that 's another 
And the first kind of invasion of the first type of privacy seemed invaded to me and very much everyday in this country 
but in the second time at least overtly uh where someone comes in and uh finds out information about you that should be private uh does not seem uh um obviously everyday 
I I think I agree with that 
I think in a good example on the typical thing that happens uh when the phone rang 
and it 's I calling 
my immediate reaction is that it 's some sort of strange phone message 
and then I realize oh no this is something I solicited 
That 's right 
so my immediate reaction was one of that sense of invasion 
but after that I realized no I I really wanted this 
and it was sort of exciting 
and so that was almost an example of s- an invasion that turns out to be not invasive 
Uh-huh 
Right 
it turned out to be uh uh an invitation 
Exactly 
Uh and at the same time I think that I receive on on the order of uh probably seven or eight a week calls of the nature where one wishes that there were a convenient way to just hang up on it 
From from personal parties or from these um phone answer phone uh commercial things 
Commercial sol- solicitations primarily 
Oh that that 's a remarkable number 
I get them rarely 
and I 'm still astounded that that one they let anyone do them and two that they have any effect in this whatsoever 
Um because I 'm usually so insulted by them I just hang up as soon as I recognize what they are 
Yeah 
I think they prey on people 's um inherent politeness on the phone even with the machine 
I find people being kind of polite and waiting for it to finish what it has to say 
and then they feel an obligation to respond even though there 's not even a person there 
And I think that 's what makes one feel invaded is the fact that there seems to be little control 
and you one 's feeling obligated because of some sense of of the way the ritual is played out 
Uh-huh 
Uh-huh 
Uh-huh 
And and uh that that then ends up being the the most common example for me 
Uh-huh 
Uh-huh 
Um I guess I 'm not typically feeling invaded in my privacy relative to this second this one that you raised 
Yeah 
And I do n't think I would have thought about that 
I think that 's a good idea on your part 
I do n't typically feel intruded on on the things uh the sense of finding out information 
Well presumably those who find out such information if they are doing it I would prefer to not to be known 
and I mean you know the classic oh I do n't know I A conspiracy theories or whatever would have such parties trying to do it without your knowledge 
So there 's things that invade that second type of privacy where you do know about them and possibly things that invade that second type of privacy without you knowing about it 
and I ca n't talk about the second one other than to to to generate paranoia 
It 's a surmise 
and I 'd like to think that it 's quite low at least in this country 
To to surmise It is there 
I do n't think I 'd like the is monitoring my phone or anything like that 
Well I guess although I well that 's a good point where you said that how does one define what invasion of privacy is because uh if that 's the case of a tree falling in the forest 
Uh-huh 
yeah 
and I 'm not feeling invaded then maybe my privacy has n't been because I have no sense of my privacy state having been invaded 
Uh-huh 
Uh if you 're defining it in terms of information gone even if it 's something you do n't know about it well then I guess one could assume one was invaded 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
but I do n't feel invaded by it 
Uh-huh 
I do n't have a sense of threat in general from those sorts of things 
uh-huh 
I 'm not sure why 
Uh I guess it comes from a sense of fact or facts 
and if someone finds out something about me that is true I I do n't have a sense of loss from that 
Uh-huh 
Well you must have a relatively clean conscience then 
Um the the other side of that might be if if someone found out something or surmised something that were n't true then I would feel probably more invaded in the gossipy sort of sense 
Yes 
yes 
ev- more harmed or something 
Bec- right 
because you do n't have anyway to turn it off 
Yeah 
Tho- did you hear about this Lotus data base that was being put together 
Yes 
I did 
I was just about to write a letter when I heard they canceled it 
That would be an example where my sense of threat would be high because I would find that there be cou- a good possibly that their facts were were fantasy 
Uh-huh 
uh-huh 
And then I would feel not only invaded in the sense that someone had obtained information from a that I would rather they did n't 
and that might be the sense of the spending pattern for instance that that I would have thought to be private 
Uh-huh uh-huh 
But then if it turns out to generate incorrect things that 's even worse 
so or if my call rate of of eight t- or so a week went up even higher because uh someone had had Uh-huh 
uh-huh 
They had you pegged 
Right 
And the person who had takes unsolicited phones calls and pays money and then all of a sudden you get your thirty a week because now they 're advertising you 
Yeah 
Yeah 
Right 
Exactly 
Yeah 
And um one of the problems with the Lotus data base was um that it was uncontrolled access to who would have that information 
I mean they said they would give it out to only select companies 
but um you know just like software is only given out to customers 
I mean you ca n't believe that 
Right 
Right 
It would it would be pirated 
and they would n't bother to check that carefully anyway to someone who 's offering you know full cash price for it 
Right 
I mean you know you ca n't tell it what a company really has to do with it 
and there 's something rather ominous about having virtually anyone any hacker being able to know what your income is what your spending habits are 
and you know and and that hacker just has to get in to in touch with the sneak thief 
and suddenly and then what started as an invasion of privacy can be an invasion of your actual home 
Uh-huh 
And I guess that turns out to be the basic problem with any invasion of privacy is whether or not you 're feeling threatened as a result of of it 
Yeah 
so maybe that is a a little bit of what privacy is 
Yes 
Exactly 
Uh-huh 
I also thought about it was of uh waiting to talk to you that another thing that occurred to me is there is not so much invasion of my privacy because I know how to behave such that there is n't 
But I realized I have to behave in a certain way in order to not have people invade my privacy 
If I deviate from social norms of behavior if I run up and down the street yelling or something someone 's going to invade my privacy very quickly 
Uh-huh 
And I realize that that I mean I can take that for granted 
but I used to I used to live in India 
and things are quite different there in terms of that 
There 's less of a sense of privacy 
In fact it 's said that no Indian language has a word for privacy 
certainly the language I know does n't but just says a word for loneliness 
Oh that 's interesting 
Loneliness is the closest you can come which is really quite different 
But but no concept for wanting to be private 
Yeah 
It 's it 's generally being alone is not a very desirable state at least officially 
Okay 
Um so there 's not I mean doors do n't have latches on them 
People do n't tend to knock 
you just if there 's a door closed and you open it because it 's in your way 
you people walk in out 
and as a as a westerner in India and I was often surprised and felt my sense of privacy there was quite invaded 
Oh 
That that would be That would be culturally shocking 
You know it very much is 
But on the other hand I realized I could go out on the street and act like a complete lunatic 
Uh-huh 
and people would leave me alone 
Uh-huh 
Whereas in this country where everyone respects the closed doors very much if you go out and then act like the lunatic you you violate the uh the norms of social of um public behavior 
Um people start paying attention to you very much 
and they start asking questions and in the sense are invite- invade invading your privacy although if you know what the social norms are you know quote unquote you asked for it 
But it does mean that you have yet another reason to follow a set of social norms 
Yes 
And which is n't of always the case in all cultures 
and it was n't until I was thinking about it just now that I realized that 's actually something that 's culturally relative 
Tha- that is true 
I have n't thought about that 
and and that it 's fascinating to to think a lot of someone who does n't know how to say private 
Uh-huh 
uh-huh 
And that 's really um well I mean I I wonder how people have sex and things like that 
I mean they a- you go to India 
and it 's obvious you know the results of sex are quite obvious as the population goes up an extra hundred million every few years 
Um but I I just do n't quite um there 's hope I actually for al- of the time I 've spent there I still do n't quite understand how certain things that I assume and require privacy and require not just that you be alone but actually that you have a sense of privacy 
Yes 
Because anyone can be alone for some period of time 
but for me a lot of what I do requires a sense that there 's this invisible barrier around me which people wil- will respect 
Yes 
And if that 's gone um I I really do n't know how to live very well 
and I wonder I really do wonder how people do that 
That 's interesting 
Are th- are there any other specific things that that you feel like where where you feel your privacy to be invaded on a day-to-day basis or either on a growing frequency 
All the class- the other classic examples the Jehovah 's Witness or or Mormons or someone knocking at the front door um which is more intrusive because I have to really tell someone to go away 
And there 's that sense of I have now opened my door they now see what I look like what I live like 
and nor- and they 're doing something that normally I really only invite people to 
Okay 
Because I any anyone any friend anyone I give my number to is welcome to call me 
but no one is just welcome to come by my house 
So that is more of a sense of invasion 
So that 's another example of the invasion because of the not so Have you ever gotten one of those calls that is either generated by a computer or somebody going down a list 
and they 're either offering a service 
or they 're introducing some new product in the area 
and normally when they call you 're either in the shower 
or you 're in the middle of cooking something 
and you have to stop everything to run to the phone 
Yes 
yes 
Is is that one that you 're talking about That was the big one I 'm talking about 
I work weird hours 
and invariably just about the time I 'm going to sleep the phone tears off the wall 
Uh-huh 
uh-huh 
And you are trying to crawl out of a half unconscious sleep and answer the phone 
you either hear the cli- as soon as you say hello you hear the click of the recording coming on 
Uh-huh 
or you hear somebody all ready starting reading off a list of stuff that they 've read probably a thousand times that day already 
That 's true 
or the ones that are are generated by a computer 
It 's just a computer voice that comes on the line 
Those are the ones that I really really hate too 
I 've even had some of them 
the they 're voice activated 
and you 've got to say hello twice before they 'll do anything 
Uh-huh 
uh-huh 
Yeah 
sometimes I I get them on my uh answering machine at home 
so and I hate that when I 've got a whole bunch of messages 
and I go through them 
and most of them are n't from anybody at all 
What I would love to see done to stop all of this Uh-huh 
we 've got a thing in this country 
you can have your phone number unlisted 
Uh-huh 
and I think a law should be passed to where any of these people I think it 's great that you know freedom of speech in this country and everything but if they 're going to offer these services or these recorded message everything they ought to be stuck working with the phone book like everybody else instead of using a computer to go through and just go down every sequence of numbers for this certain area code and call them 
Uh-huh 
yes 
see I have an unlisted telephone number 
but I still get all of those calls 
and then some of them are speaking in a foreign language that I do n't even understand 
So yeah 
I do 
I really feel that 's uh an invasion of my privacy 
I agree with you on that particular subject there 
Let me see 
That 's about that as far as any other everyday occurrences 
I put a stop to some of them as far as the door to door either religious groups or people peddling products 
If I wanted their products I would have either gone to the store to bought it 
or I would have called for their salesman to come out 
Uh-huh 
uh-huh 
Yeah 
that 's true 
Living in an apartment complex though you know you ca n't um you ca n't really stop those people from coming around even though they put up signs out front that says no solicitations uh 
but they still come up to the front door and uh you know walk around 
So usually what I do is I 'll call the apartment manager and tell them hey there 's people coming around you know 
and they 're trying to sell something 
or or they 're from a religious organization 
and I really hate that 
I really really do 
I had somebody come to the door about two weeks ago 
and uh gosh it was about nine o'clock at night too 
It was n't even what I would consider you know family hours 
time to you know start going to bed 
and uh and it was somebody from um oh what was it the uh Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints 
and uh I 've read a lot about uh that particular sect 
and I do n't particularly care for it 
so I especially do n't like for them to come up to my door and and try and talk to me 
Now I agree with their right to uh pursue their religion of choice in that whatever manner they want to 
but I think they should also respect the sanctity of the American home whether it be in a house or in an apartment 
I 'm on my turf 
if I want them there I 'll call for them 
otherwise I do n't want to know they exist 
Yeah 
yeah 
no 
I I agree with you there 
If they want to choose that particular religion that 's fine with me too you know as long as they do n't try and pull me in and drag me in 
And and I do n't like the way that they do it either 
and and it 's their mission that they do it 
They go door to door 
and they go out into the public 
and they actually have the uh teenagers serving two years like you would say like in an army and two years in going around and doing missionary type work 
and uh I do n't know 
I just um do n't particularly care for that at all 
And that that 's one thing that I feel really strongly about though is uh you know people coming up to my door and especially religious organizations and wanting to uh you know to try and get me to join or you know become interested in their religion 
because I have my own 
Now the part about where you said the apartment complex puts up signs that says no soliciting 
I 've even gone so far as to put that I 've got a storm door on the front of the house 
and I 've put in I do n't know how much clearer it can be 
it 's a red sign with silver letters saying no soliciting 
I should have I guess I should make another one that says religious or otherwise cause I still get Yeah 
yeah 
that 's true 
yeah 
No 
I do n't uh I do n't have I did n't go that far 
but uh yeah 
I probably could do the same thing uh you know 
I do n't have a storm door 
but I 'm sure I could rig up something 
But you know I do n't think that that would stop people 
I it 's like they see that word 
and it says go instead of stop 
Oh goodness 
I wonder if there would be some way we could get these people to do this get their names their addresses and their phone numbers 
and then reverse it 
and do well that would be technically illegal 
it would be harassment 
Oh gosh 
But I consider an invasion of my privacy a harassment in itself 
Yeah 
yeah 
Yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
that 's true 
that 's true um 
Well what else 
I believe we 've pretty much summed everything up 
I know 
but I remember you you talked about something 
you started off and said well let me think 
you talked about the telephone calls and people coming and soliciting and selling things at the door 
You said something else 
I ca n't remember what it was 
and I thought yeah 
that that kind of touched a nerve right there 
but we got uh we got to talking about the uh uh people coming to you at the front door 
I 'm drawing a blank 
Oh goodness 
okay 
is our five minutes up 
Uh pretty close to it 
Pretty close 
Well I 've enjoyed talking with you 
Well it was nice talking to you too Jim 
And take it easy now 
Okay 
thanks 
bye 
Good night 
Hello 
Hello 
Hi 
Hello 
this is Lois 
Hi 
hi 
this is Lisa 
And uh I called you know from that the the I Data Base Calling Instructions 
Uh-huh 
Yeah 
I got a call yesterday too 
This is a different subject though 
Yeah 
this is about changes in the women in the Uh-huh 
Uh there 's really a lot is n't there 
Yeah 
I think there really is 
It 's kind of an easy thing to talk about 
Oh I guess the work force would be the main would n't it 
Yeah uh 
I think you have to push one 
and then we can start recording it 
Okay 
All right 
Okay 
Are you ready now 
Yes 
Okay 
like I said I guess it would be the work force you know as far as changes in the generations 
Yes 
I know because I know when my mother was a you know going into the work force there was n't very many opportunities for her I guess 
she 's in her late forties 
You were expected to stay home and take care of the kids 
and I 've never faced that at all 
Uh no 
I think no- now you go to work when they 're six weeks old you know 
Uh-huh 
and you stay there 
And I feel like the next generation you 'll probably just work right along with your husband you know 
Yeah 
uh-huh 
I think it 's definitely gotten better 
Oh I do to much 
And it 's just going to get better 
Uh-huh 
It really is 
Because women are in every field now 
I mean I ca n't think of a field that they 're not involved in 
Oh I ca n't either not a one 
And I know at least in the medical field it seems like they 've come out with a lot further advances as far as female medications and things since women have gotten into the doctor field 
Uh-huh 
I do n't think that men really took the time to work on that sort of thing 
Yeah 
even in Washington you know there seems to be a lot more women involved 
Yeah 
Hopefully the next generation it wo n't even be an issue 
I mean people will just look at you as a person and not as a man or a woman 
Yeah 
yeah 
I think that would be the best goal 
Oh I do too 
just your qualifications 
and that would be it 
Uh-huh 
exactly 
not what color you are how old you are what you 're male or female 
That would be wonderful 
I guess it 's kind of an ideal world though huh 
Yeah 
I kind of think maybe in time that you know you 'll go by social security numbers you know 
Yeah 
and that way they ca n't say well they picked a male over a female female over a male you know 
Exactly 
or the way you look 
or the way you you know Yeah 
yeah 
your age or anything 
I think that would be a wonderful way to do it 
I do to 
just go by your social security number and then look at you qualifications that you know that you have 
Uh-huh 
and then And then if you get it you know then Uh-huh 
also with uh women in the work force they 've gotten a lot more options as far as you know what 's it called job sharing 
Uh-huh 
Like if you and another lady were to share the same full time job or Oh yeah 
As a matter of fact that 's what I 'm doing 
Is it 
Uh-huh 
it sure is 
That would be great 
It sure is 
Or a lot of women I know now and my uh one of my supervisors when she went on A to have her baby we hooked up uh uh a terminal at her house 
and she you know we could send her messages 
and and she kept in touch like that and basically just worked out of her house 
Oh 
I would just take her the actual paperwork once uh every week or two 
and that worked out great too 
Yeah 
yeah 
that is 
And that 's a real attractive option if you have the the technology for it 
Uh-huh 
All it was was you know I mean she just used a phone modem 
and she was like she was sitting in the office 
so I think that 's real nice too to come up with different options 
Do you like the job sharing 
Oh I do 
Do you 
I really do 
I think it 's great 
Do you work like half days or half weeks or Uh well like one week she 'll work three days and I 'll work two 
and the next week you know I 'll work three 
and she 'll work two 
Oh oh that 's great 
and we just share off like that 
Uh-huh 
Do you get the full benefits 
Uh-huh 
yeah 
we get the full benefits 
Oh that 's wonderful 
But we 've just really got a wonderful system that we 're working under 
Yeah 
especially with children and so many things going on that would be great 
Yeah 
It really is 
and that way we 're not really missing any thing out you know of MUMBLEx children 
Either way uh-huh 
yeah 
you have your career and your home life 
and that would be a nice way especially if you have young children 
Oh it is 
it is 
well both of ours is school age 
but we do n't want to miss any of those A -s and you know all of that 
Uh-huh 
oh no 
I think yeah 
My son 's just in day-care 
but even that they have extracurricular activities 
and the older they get the more that you 're involved in that 
Uh-huh 
I think it 's great 
I really Yeah 
and I look for more of that in the next generation 
I do too especially as women get up in management and and can be in on those decision making you know when that subject comes up they can say yes 
that would be wonderful 
Yes 
oh I do too 
Plus I bet it cuts cuts down on your absenteeism because you 've got two days off that you can do everything 
so you do n't have to you know unless you 're just really sick or the child 's sick 
Most of the time now you know it 's just the weekend 
or just forget it 
Uh-huh 
oh yeah 
I have to plan way in advance because or what I 've done is found like doctors and dentists office with extended hours 
Uh-huh 
That 's been real helpful too 
like my doctor stays open til nine in the evening 
So that 's real helpful 
so you do n't you know have to do it during office hours run out on your lunch hour 
I do n't know how many times I 've done that to do something post office or the bank or any kind of errand 
To do 
yeah 
so Uh-huh 
Well I think we 've really come a long way in that because Uh-huh 
I guess I take it for granted kind of because I just it 's always been that way 
Uh-huh 
But I know Yeah 
but I can rem- remember back growing up my mother I mean it was she always worked 
but it was n't that easy for her to just take off 
Oh no 
I can remember my mother getting in trouble if you know one of was sick 
and I know she probably did n't make hardly anything you know compared to the work that she did 
Oh yeah 
I think there is still some discrimination there where as you know men and women work in the same job 
I think men get paid more 
Oh I do too 
but I think that 's improving 
It 's such a slow process 
it 's frustrating 
but you can see that it 's wrong 
Yes 
yes 
and you just want to make it right 
but at least the wheels are moving forward 
They really are 
Yeah 
I think it 's getting better not worse 
Well I should probably get back to my job 
I know 
I know the feeling 
Call again 
Okay 
I sure will 
Bye-bye 
Okay 
bye-bye 
Hi 
Hi 
um okay 
what now uh what particularly particularly what kind of music do you like 
Well I mostly listen to popular music 
I uh listen to it all the time in in my car 
so I I tend to be one of those people who switches stations a lot because I do n't like commercials 
But uh I find myself listening to popular music 
Yeah 
and uh quite honestly I I have some little children 
and I unfortunately found myself listening to a lot of nursery rhyme music here lately 
but that 's not by my choice 
Oh really 
How about you 
Well um I do n't have that I do n't have that experience to share 
Lucky you 
I I do I do listen to a lot of you know I do I switch the stations a lot because I do n't have a cassette player in my car 
Um um Uh-huh 
Uh uh however I I do I do like a lot of different forms of music 
so I switch quite often 
Um I think I like I I 'm really particular about the type of music that I listen to 
Uh-huh 
But the uh there 's such a wide selection 
I think I like a lot I like a little bit of a lot of different types of music 
You know I I I like music that is that I feel if it is performed correctly or if it 's done right or if the version is done right I like it 
Yeah 
but if if it 's not then I wo n't 
I I really do n't How do you feel about rap music 
Rap 
It seems to be so popular these days 
Yeah 
Well I I do n't really have anything against rap music 
I the one thing I do object to about rap music is is when it becomes militant or if it 's uh violence oriented 
Uh-huh 
Right 
I I have strong objections to that 
Um actually I listen to one time I remember this was back when even uh I would say about ten or fifteen years ago I When it was really just starting 
Yeah 
right 
when it was just starting I heard what was called talking blues which actually is rap 
Yeah 
Uh-huh 
Uh-huh 
And uh it was about the the piece of music the piece of music was about I think about forty or fifty years old 
And it was incredible I mean the parallel you know between it and rap 
Right 
And um you you listen a lot if you if you hear a lot of old gospel uh uh especially well the black gospel 
You know you will you know you can really pick it up I mean 
Yeah 
you really It seemed to be influenced by a lot of different music 
A lot of times you 'll hear songs that you know they 're not original but have been put to a rap kind of a rhythm 
Yeah 
And uh sounds it sounds so much different 
and yet I I have a much younger sister who listens to a lot of rap music 
and uh she thinks it 's pretty funny how often I know all of the words to songs that she 's listening to 
and yet she thought they were brand new original pieces 
Yeah 
Yeah 
they they do they do copy versions they do cover versions of of you know like standards I guess you could call it 
That 's right 
I think it 's kind of absurd you know the fact that you know they do n't really they do n't really give you know the original artist or the original composer the credit that is really due to them 
No 
Yeah 
I guess there was even a a bit of ruckus caused by the Hammer who 's really you know 
Yeah 
seems to be the hot one of of today 
He used um 
Do you remember that that song 
Yeah 
he used um I ca n't remember who the artist was on that 
Jimi Hendrix was the original 
Who 
Jimi Hendrix was the original 
He wrote Was it well ma- maybe it was n't that one 
Because it was a living it was a living person that I 'm I 'm thinking of that um that said You know hey that those are my words 
Okay 
And uh I guess that they because they had n't originally gotten um permission from him to use it 
Uh-huh 
And he he since then has has amended that and paid them his royalties every time the the song goes on 
but Yeah 
I do n't know 
it may have it may have been somebody else because I think I think that even Jimi Hendrix did it 
I think that was a cov- you know come to think of it I think that was a cover version of like a John Lee Hooker song or something 
Maybe so 
I I ca n't think 
I mean it was just like it was really old 
I mean I I there are a lot there are so many different songs 
I mean like the whole thing about cover versions a lot of times I mean I 've heard some songs that that I just thought were horrendous cover versions of I 'm like you know I I do n't want to listen to this Because you know you think of the original is like Yeah 
you know oh that was really great 
That was a you know a really good piece of work 
and then when you hear the cover it 's like you know God what are they doing 
Right 
They destroyed it 
I I think a good one was um there was a Peter Frampton song 
Oh yeah 
and then the cover version I think I mean I thought was absolutely it was pitiful 
I I remember seeing the video of it on 
and I thought it was hideous 
Yeah 
I did too 
It was ugh I did n't like that either 
Yeah 
but you know whatever became of Peter Frampton 
I mean there was nothing he was a phenomenon 
I me- there was no reason for him to really come into you know great stardom or anything 
I remember I saw him in a concert when I was Yeah 
Yeah 
I think I think it I think it was in high school 
Yeah 
I think that probably what did it for him was the fact that he was a good stage performer 
Uh-huh 
He was very good 
I remember I saw him in a huge stadium in uh Philadelphia 
It was in Stadium if I can remember 
Oh man 
Hundreds of thousands of people is what it seemed like 
Yeah 
I 've I graduated back in seventy-nine 
so Um um Uh-huh 
but but I 've really I I loved I mean I was I was really into the album oriented music even then 
Uh-huh 
so I was really familiar with a lot with a lot of of the A type music 
Um the album oriented like the uh James Taylor and the uh the Beatles 
Oh yeah 
and you know I mean a lot of people they go they 're better than the Beatles 
and I 'm like you know you do n't know what you 're talking about 
No 
I mean the comparison made between New Kids On The Block with the Beatles It was just You can only laugh 
Yeah 
you just sort of you know well I guess I can just humor them you know At this point 
Right 
well they I guess our age is showing when we we think that 
Yeah 
but well you know I I I 've liked a lot of the new music 
I think um um when Uh-huh 
I saw some promise you know with with a lot of the new wave when it when it came out uh back in the mid and early eighties 
Yeah 
And then um I do n't know 
music is kind of in a weird it 's in a very weird position right now 
I think that I mean I like you know things like to hear you know what they call world music Which is you know using all these natural forms of music 
and Like Paul Simon 
Like Yeah 
yeah 
Paul Simon 
Yeah 
Well you know really that 's not world music 
But what what Paul Simon 's doing I think is is is great because he 's you know I think I think that using I guess what they call it is eclectic you know drawing from a lot of different sources and making you know a synthesis of a new type of music Um 
Yeah 
What do you mean by world music 
Well world music is um a lot of the a lot of where they where they make music that they adapt to a to another kind of to another type of listener 
Uh-huh 
Uh for example let 's say you 're taking like an original Brazilian form of music and with a certain style 
and then you try to make it a little bit more listenable for let 's say another audience let 's say a North American 
Uh-huh 
And then when they hear it it it 's a really it 's another form of music and you know sort of um trying to draw out the best sources 
Um 
The the best of every type of music 
Right 
Because I mean there are some I mean I I li- there are some you know types of heavy metal that I really like 
but but I would n't I would n't say that I I completely like heavy metal 
No 
I I think you know and it 's the same way with you know world music takes the forms that have really been um I guess I you know the best example or you know the cream of the crop I guess you could say and then and then taking those those qualities and then applying in the styles that are really um that are extremely enjoyable and then taking So then it becomes a kind of music of of its own so to speak 
or uh Yeah 
yeah 
it becomes a kind of music of its own 
I mean when you listen to it it 's um uh I think that they do n't use elec- some of it it 's they use electronic and acoustic interchangeably 
Uh-huh 
so you know well a lot of the stuff you hear coming from South Africa now and from West Africa that 's considered world music because it 's not particularly using certain types of folk styles 
Right 
But they 're they 're trying to make it somewhat more modern 
I I I a good another good example was I heard Miles Davis 
and Miles Davis worked with Robbie Shoncar if you can believe it 
Uh-huh 
I mean You know he 's a jazz performer 
Uh-huh 
and then he 's playing with Robbie Shoncar who 's a very good he 's a very good arranger 
Uh arrangement to uh we 're going to have to get off 
The are they trying to MUMBLEx I do n't know 
But uh MUMBLEx We 've talked our five minutes though 
Yeah 
okay 
but I mean when I heard his album I heard it and it was just incredible 
I 've been listening to that a lot lately 
Yeah 
I I listened and I heard you know you hear this guitar 
and then you hear the muted trumpet 
I me and you never would think that they that they can actually play together 
but Oh yeah 
Okay 
so um yes 
we do keep uh well we started out keeping a budget about two years ago 
we have a computer here at the house 
Uh-huh 
and I made a Lotus spreadsheet and went through the year using all of our our checkbook to figure out what we spent each time and whether we were over or under for each month 
and then basically since then what I 've done is is keep track of it through the checkbook 
so that based on whatever we 've got coming in the check coming in then how much I 'm spending each half of the month and then trying to also spe- because our house payment is once a month 
that 's our our biggest uh expense 
so I take half of that amount out of my checkbook each with each paycheck even thought it 's really still there so that I can keep uh uh good balance a running total yeah through the month 
Uh-huh 
Uh-huh 
A running total 
Yeah 
What do you all do 
Uh we 've we 've uh taken how much we have you know write down how much we have coming in each month 
and then uh we 've at the beginning of the year we sat down and determined how much we could spend 
We sat dow- made up different accounts like you know 
we 've set a budget for each you know household expenses or food and clothing and entertainment and then our our own fun money and just stuff like that 
and then we write down each each time we spend something we write down in a book 
and at the end of the month we tally it up to see how close we you know we we try to stay within a certain budget 
so Is it is it hard to keep track of it 
or does it work out pretty well 
Um it takes some it takes some dedication to do it 
but it it works out real well 
so And and you 're staying within your budget and keep- everything is working pretty good 
Uh-huh 
Yeah 
yeah 
I stay wi- I have to stay within it 
so I you know and then we have that you know if you ca n't stay if something comes up and you ca n't stay within it then we have uh you know a budget for you know like we call our slush fund or something 
and some- an unexpected comes up then you 're not you know you do n't feel it so strapped 
You do n't have to go out and borrow it somewhere and do that 
Right 
yeah 
because we do n't you know we do n't charge anything that we ca n't pay off by the end of the month 
That 's a good choice 
we 've been trying we 're trying to uh do that this year 
We 've budgeted the money that we used to spend we were spending on a account with I and then money we were also buying stock with for that year 
we 've taken that this year and said we 're going to pay off all of our credit cards 
You 've got paper under your table 
and uh we have uh another loan with the bank 
Uh-huh 
Uh-huh 
and so we hope by the end of this year that by doing that we 'll be free and clear 
To be out of that 
Free 
Yeah 
the only thing we have it to pay off is our is a automobile loan and our house payment 
and that 's the only thing we ever That 's good to be in that kind of shape 
We try to stay out of debt 
What are you all trying to do long term 
Huh Oh it 's long term 
We just he ha- you know his retirement plan and then to and stuff like that that 's all we and you know we just have our life insurance for right now 
Uh-huh 
So we do n't have any long term you know in stocks or anything like that right now 
so Yeah 
mostly what we 're doing we 've worked we 've done the uh account with I where they we put in so much a month 
and then they or so much a pay check and then they match it 
Yeah 
that 's what we 're doing 
So that 's that 's worked out pretty good 
and then I used to work for I 
and I have when I retired from there or left I took the money I that I had in mine and put it in an I A 
and we had an out we had an existing I A 
so we have both of us have some money in an I A that we 're also trying to figure to put it we 're putting it in 's right now 
Uh-huh 
and then we 're also looking at it in possibly getting a mutual fund 
Yeah 
when ever we get enough saved we stick it in a for a while 
and then uh you know and then when if we need it we wait until it it 's expired 
and then so Yeah 
The other thing that we 've done that that was really nice to see we had one of the financial companies um 
han- uh John Hancock company came out 
and their agent did a long term analysis based on salary and uh what we were pla- what what our uh goals were on a long term budget in terms of retirement kids college paying off the house buying a different house um special thing buying land and building our own house 
Uh-huh 
and they did an analysis for us based on what we were putting in and the time frame that we wanted to look at and then gave us a good idea back you know some good information back on whether or not we were going to achieve those goals and or not and what we needed to do so that we could achieve them and the money we could put in at what time 
Uh-huh 
or not 
yeah 
Uh-huh 
That sounds interesting 
we 've never done any- we have you know just our our life insurance guy has come out you know 
and he 's set up uh you know determined how much we need to you know we need if something were to happen 
Yeah 
that that 's the other financial thing I guess that we 've done is with our life insurance is since I 'm at home now is is figuring out uh what we would need if something happened to my husband or what he would need if something happened to me 
that 's a a big thing to think about 
Right 
yeah you know 
if I would sell the you know if he something would happen to him I would n't stay in Texas 
I would uh sell the house and move back home you know to my home town 
and and uh I would n't stay here in Texas 
so you know I do n't know what he would do 
Okay 
I guess that 's most of my um financial plans right now 
Yeah 
mine too 
Is is there anything you 'd like to add 
No 
that 's about all for mine 
Well it 's been nice talking to you 
Nice talking to you too 
Bye bye 
Bye bye 
Okay 
Wonderful touch tone telephone there 
Uh what kind of books do you enjoy reading 
Uh have n't have I have a wide variety of of hobbies 
therefore my my reading pleasures are quite wide 
Um I get a charge out of uh which is uh very colorful and uh not being a native of Texas but being here eleven years have a tendency to uh find out the uh about the different areas of the co- of the of the state by reading it 
Oh 
Right 
I 've read that one too 
I only had a subscription once 
but my mother always gave me hers 
and I I really enjoyed you know all the little things that you find out about Texas 
Oh yeah 
it 's it 's uh absolutely it 's great the way that it 's broken out and you can uh set up little trips and day trips and things 
It 's pretty pretty neat 
Um oh I like photography um magazines 
I do n't take a subscription or anything like that 
Um things oh being an engineer in facilities I do read a lot of a lot of uh building magazines and and and plant engineering magazines and read up on different ways to do things and energy management type of magazines 
and and uh kind of strange because I it 's not unusual to uh see uh an engineering manual or something laying around the house 
Uh-huh 
and then I 'll sit up and read just to refresh uh you know to keep active on it 
but uh Uh-huh 
How about yourself 
Well um I have an interest in art 
so I frequently purchase and read uh books mainly on water color because that 's my big interest at the moment 
Oh that 's great 
And uh oh I guess I like a variety of things uh lots of fiction uh type books 
Uh right now I 'm occasionally reading on a book about uh the Mardi Gras in New Orleans and its history 
Uh-huh 
That 's fairly interesting 
I bet that would be rather interesting 
Uh that 's uh self improvement 
that 's that 's alwa- well that 's kind of a hobby 
but it is self improvement from the standpoint of probably relaxing uh 
Yeah 
I do n't know that I read anything strictly labeled self improvement 
How about you 
Um well I hate to yes 
I do 
We uh we have these classes we attend uh management classes 
and and they give you books 
and and the last book uh matter of fact I read was by Carl Albrecht 
It talks about uh who the customer is and being customer oriented uh which falls in line with the I culture here at Texas Instruments 
Yeah 
Uh one of its great slogans is if you 're not serving the customer you better be serving someone who is 
Uh-huh 
Uh so that 's all in self improvement to stay focused on who the customer is 
and as you probably well know all of us are our own customer 
You 're my customer I 'm your customer sort of thing 
Right 
Um every now and then I 'm loaned a tape I can stick in the uh in the car cassette set on the way home to make the drive more enjoyable talking about uh better outlooks on things and the philosophy of of Pat Hagerty and these kind of uh mind stimulating philosophy type Which all you know betters yourself 
Yeah 
Yeah 
yeah 
well uh maybe I am into some things occasionally that I do n't think of in terms of self improvement 
Uh-huh 
I mean they are 
but I do n't label it as such 
Like what for example 
Well I do n't know um 
I uh have attended some seminars that had some tapes that went with them but uh I guess not so much books although they sometimes have manuals and things 
but uh they would be things on like how to be successful and sort of talking to yourself You know ge- getting your yourself in gear to uh sort of pull yourself up by your boot straps and do what you really want to do Convincing you that you need to get on with it 
Sure 
Sure 
How about items like um which used to be a big okay 
Yes 
So those are self improvements 
Sure 
Um our supervisor uh subtly bought all of us a book called By a man man named Doctor Bittel I 
Um 
and it 's a very layman 's uh uh approach towards managing different types of people 
And the very last chapter and I have n't figured out why that one was last is how to manage engineers 
So it 's it 's ver- it 's interesting 
here again it 's it 's casual reading 
and it 's not eaten up with a lot of uh mechanical stuff 
and it 's really excellent fast reading 
and uh but as you say it 's it 's sometimes it 's difficult to to know if it 's you know I think if somebody would say hey read these ten books because these are self-improvements I would probably be turned off to them 
Yeah 
yeah 
If he casually just walked into it and uh put down a Stephen King book and I picked up one of them I might be a little more interested 
I do n't know 
I 'm not sure I could take too much of Stephen King 
That 's a little little heavy for me 
Yeah 
they 're uh quite uh they 're hard to set down because it 's so interesting 
and of course they 're all just a little spookier than the movies 
but uh it 's always they 're always challenging to get through one of them 
Yeah 
I have a hard time finishing books 
Well I guess I also have been reading uh a lot of things on uh quality improvement and that type of thing because that 's what I 'm involved in a lot at work 
Uh-huh 
In quality especially now days uh that 's almost everything that comes across the the the airways MUMBLEx 
Oh yeah 
you could almost label everything quality in some sense or other 
but uh I think sometimes the word is a little over used 
Exactly exactly right 
but Yeah we we have I think we we name drop it a little too much and and do n't fully understand what what it is we 're saying 
I think it 's just focusing in on the issue and walking your talk 
and and all that kind of rolls in together there 
Yeah 
but uh that 's just kind of part of it 
Okay 
well any other comments 
Uh not that I can think of 
Um I think I 'm under my quota a little bit 
I need to probably make a phone call or two 
Well we just started 
right 
Uh this is true 
I 've enjoyed it 
Well you too 
and uh good-bye 
Have a good day 
Good-bye 
Bye-bye 
Okay um 
I do n't know about you 
but where I am we have a like an extremely lax dress policy at work 
and it varies like every day I mean from jeans one day to business suits the next 
It 's pretty bad 
but it 's true you know 
they tend to try to be you know real lax 
and supposedly the policy is like you know we you know we hire these wonderful creative people 
and we do n't want to smush their creativity you know 
We want to go ahead and let them do what ever they want 
And you know you really will see people in in jeans one day and business suits the next 
Well I 'm kind of that way too 
I work in the legal department 
and where we are now what we 're doing is some very big lawsuits that happen to have a heck of a lot of boxes of documents 
Yeah 
And I get to toting around boxes of documents several times a day 
it always seems like I 'm doing that 
and I ca n't see getting dressed up and wearing heels and stuff when you have to carry you know boxes of documents around 
so if I 'm just going to be there working in the litigation center and doing you know odds and ends and stuff with the boxes of documents I dress down 
But if we 're going to have a meeting where we 're having the attorneys come in or people from uh other party 's attorneys and stuff then I normally dress up 
Yeah 
and I 'll wear a dress and hose and stuff 
Yeah 
you know we 're kind of that way too 
I try to I 'm the same way you are 
I kind of try to judge from day to day 
I know you know where I am we work a lot with the customers 
and we have a lot of government folks come in all the time 
and and you know if I know that they 're going to be there you know you I try to really watch it and like you say you know really dress up 
Uh-huh 
and if I know they 're not you know I I 've been doing a lot of reorganization you know the last couple of months the same way you are you know 
Uh-huh 
and it 's just MUMBLEx it 's just impossible to crawl down on the floor and dig through boxes in a dress 
That 's right 
that 's right 
It is 
and so As a matter of fact I thought I had one funny story 
when uh I was at I the first year or so we were sent out to our record retention facility to look through two thousand boxes 
We had them in the warehouse 
Uh 
and at that point it the warehouse was over across the road 
and it was n't air conditioned 
and it we were there like in the middle of the summer 
it 's unair-conditioned 
it was dusty and dirty uh 
there was like a fan at the very end of the row 
and that was it 
And so we did n't really know we were n't supposed to we thought I dress code was just dress appropriate to your job 
Uh-huh 
we wore shorts 
We did n't know that was a big no no 
Oh no 
And the supervisor from another area came up to us 
and you know this area where record retention is there 's only a few people that work there 
and he sho- he knew who worked there 
he should have realized that we were n't regulars in the warehouse there 
And he came up to us 
and he just said who 's your supervisor 
Well he called our supervisor and our supervisor and our supervisor 's supervisor 
and it went up all the way to the head of facilities complaining that we were wearing shorts 
Oh no 
He did n't at at least say to us did you know you 're not supposed to do that 
That could have alleviated a big problem 
We ended up getting called out on it 
Oh how awful 
It sounds like Mister Power Hungry 
Yeah 
You know just yesterday though I saw a girl in the spine out here at Lewisville that had on a pair of shorts 
Uh-huh 
And I do n't care 
you can call them split skirts 
and you can call them culottes all you want 
but these were shorts 
That 's all they were 
I do n't care what else you call them you know 
if they 're below the knee okay 
maybe you can call them split skirts 
If they 're above the knee they turn into shorts you know 
And these were n't even really full ones 
I mean they had a problem out here with it last summer wearing these shorts that were you know the real wide full ones you know 
and becau- these were n't even those 
These were like pretty short black 
and they were very dressy 
the were black velvet shorts 
and she had on black hose and black heels 
and she looked very very nice 
Um 
But you do n't wear shorts to work 
You know I mean MUMBLEx as far as I 'm considered she was in violation 
and nobody says anything to them 
It 's always been a big problem in Lewisville in the summertime 
Um 
You know if they just you know the management does n't ever seem to want to take an cut off you know that no 
this is wear we 're going to draw the line 
This is shorts you know 
Yeah 
And and nobody will ever kind of take control and do that you know 
Um 
so it always gets annoying because the rest of us are going well God we have a pair of those at home too 
It sure would be cool and comfortable to wear you know 
but Well I 've seen some people try to just come in like over the weekend because they want to use the TexTeller machine 
Yeah 
And they have said no 
Yeah 
and then during the week you see these women in the you know 
just because you put on a pair of hose with them does n't make them not shorts anymore you know 
Yeah 
I mean I 've never seen them do it without hose 
I mean they always have hose on 
but still it 's they 're shorts 
I do n't care what you say 
they 're shorts 
Well I think I 's dress code is pretty lax considering everything anyway you know uh 
I know I did n't know that has a very strict dress code 
I had a friend 
Oh do they really 
Oh definitely 
I had a friend who worked there for a year or so 
and they spell it out 
For men it 's particular suits uh the pin stripe and the particular colors of shirts and win- wing tipped shoes 
Oh my God 
Oh it is definitely lined out 
Women are not allowed to wear slacks 
you wear coordinated suits 
I coul- I could n't afford to work there 
And and a particular kind of shoe you know so high heel 
oh it is spelled out 
Oh no 
When I was looking at her materials when she first started you know she had her benefits package and all that kind of stuff 
Uh-huh 
And it told about the dress code 
and it said these are the color pastel shirts you may wear or white shirts with this kind of stripe in it for the men and this kind of shoe and hair just this way 
I -s says no shorts and no halters 
I know that 's it 
Yeah 
and is very particular about this hair cuts 
Wow 
I mean it was like you ca n't have you know such and such facial hair no beards you know and just really detailed 
I do n't know that that would be a good environment to work in 
I mean I see 
I I am more I do n't know about anybody else 
and a lot of bosses may say I 'm nuts 
but I am more productive when I 'm in pants 
I I am 
I work faster 
I get things done faster than when I 'm in a dress and heels you know 
I and it 's weird 
but I it 's I do I can I can get so much more done if I 'm dressed comfortable you know 
Well the the time we were there at the warehouse we felt really bad because we had uh another person coming from Washington our outside counsel 
And she was told that we were going to be in a warehouse 
but she really did n't get the idea that we were in the warehouse part of the warehouse not the office to the warehouse but the warehouse 
Right 
And she came with skirts just like she 'd be going into the office 
Yeah 
And we 'd try we 'd try to say did n't you bring any pants or anything 
We 're we 're out here in the warehouse you know 
you you got your skid of you know that wooden pallet of boxes 
Uh-huh 
and you 're going to have un- unload you skid look at the documents in the in the boxes and then repack your skid 
And she And she was so she was so hot and miserable you know in the skirt 
You ca n't do that in a skirt poor soul 
Oh yuck 
She finally tried to go buy you know a pair of pants 
but you know I mean it was just completely miserable for her 
Yeah 
that 's terrible 
that 's terrible 
gosh 
Well I do n't know 
I just figure you know yeah 
sometimes I worry about you know if I go in in pants 
and I never I never ever ever ever go in in a pair of jeans you know 
But I 'll go in in pants 
I mean today I had on a pair of you know navy blue dress slacks and and uh like a peach colored top and you know not cruddy but not a dress either 
And sometimes I wonder if stuff like that would will hold you back you know if you do n't dress in you know your dress for success business suits everyday if you know if upper management does n't notice that and remember that later on 
but you know I do n't know if they do or not 
You know I see a lot of the managers 
and they 're in jeans 
so you know Some of our people in the legal department we have um assistants to the general counsel 
and it 's funny 
because there 's one that always wears a suit 
A matter of fact he 's never seen without his jacket to the suit on buttoned 
Really wow 
And then there 's another one who 's who 's a little younger and a little more yuppish 
and he 's always kind of like in the khaki pants and you know a shirt 
Uh-huh 
and sometimes he wears the jacket to it 
Yeah 
And some of the patent attorneys have been real casual in their clothes 
and then other ones tend to always wear a suit with a very starched cotton shirt 
So that 's just Is n't that funny 
With the you know the little suspenders or something on 
so We 've we 've kind of had a variety there 
That 's great 
but I think a lot of times it 's it 's mainly who they 're going to meet with 
or they 're meeting with people that they know is going to be dressed that way then that 's how they are 
Yeah 
If they 're just going to be meeting with I -ers like to talk about a patent kind of thing and the they 're engineers that they 're talking too they dress kind of like how the engineers are dressed 
and they 're usually casual 
That 's the way to do it I mean that 's the smart way to do it 
Yeah 
It really is because you 're making you know if when they 're meeting with the engineers who they know are going to be dressed down if they come in in you know a six hundred dollar three piece suit it 's going to make the people they 're meeting with feel very uncomfortable you know 
or it would me you know 
It 's one of those slippery attorneys coming in here 
Yeah 
yeah 
look at this slick guy 
I wonder what kind of money does he make 
uh-huh 
I can see it now 
Well it was good to talk to you 
It was really enjoyable 
Yeah 
this is this is kind of a fun project 
It really is 
I 've done some of the other speech programs 
but we 've never got to talk to another person 
it was always just talking to the computer 
Oh yuck 
yeah 
So this is a little different 
Well it 's kind of enjoyable 
I 'm really looking forward to it 
Yeah 
Well thanks a lot 
Okay 
bye 
Bye-bye 
Okay um 
How has it been this week for you 
Weather-wise or otherwise 
Weather-wise 
Weather-wise 
Damp cold warm 
Oh no 
damp 
We have we have gone through what might be called the four seasons uh in the last week 
Uh-huh 
We have had highs of seventy-two lows in the twenties 
My goodness 
Well I do n't even want to tell you what ours has been like then 
It was ninety-six yesterday 
I heard about that 
and we set a record yesterday And uh very windy 
but then today the wind has dropped off and also the temperature so very cool uh 
I think right now it 's like sixty-nine 
Um 
and that 's cool for u- 
or it feels cool compared to yesterday but very pleasant 
no rain in the last month I do n't think 
The ground 's very dry 
and our yard work everything is in bloom 
so our yard work is pretty tough the ground being dry 
but I guess it also uh brings about allergies 
we 're having a lot of allergies down here right now 
Uh-huh 
Everything blooming 
and and the weather Uh-huh 
And uh I think a lot of people have contracted uh spring fever too 
so Had a lot of people out at work you know for fishing and and uh and golfing reasons and things like that 
The blue flu 
Yeah 
yeah 
the blue flu or the white collar flu depending on where you work I guess 
Yes 
Oh we have had uh as I 've said we have had variable weather Uh 
Um 
It has been untypically wet for this time of year 
Um 
and also we have a lot of green you know 
the grass has been growing 
and if you look outside you would like to go out and mow your lawn if you could go out and buy a new spark plug or something along those lines 
Uh 
but fortunately it rains 
and you uh do not have to go out and buy the spark plug you know 
Yeah 
But we 've had an unusually uh uh warm spring 
and well I guess we 're still in winter 
and uh we have had no snow 
Uh-huh 
No snow 
To speak of to speak of 
Um 
We usually average oh anywhere from six to twelve inches during the winter 
and this year as well as last year we have had less than four inches total accumulation 
Um 
So it 's been inordinately warm uh here for uh for this time of year 
Um 
So uh in that regard it 's fine 
but uh I envy you your ninety-four degrees 
Uh-huh 
I thought I heard this morning that in San Antonio it was in the nineties yesterday 
Yes 
yes 
it is 
Down in the more southern and western areas 
And of course we are um about two hours from the northern border straight south 
Yeah 
and and uh very windy 
It 's amazing to me 
because I have only lived in Dallas for three years 
and I can not believe that the wind blows all the time 
It does 
I I very seldom if any I ca n't remember you know a day that I walked out and the wind was n't blowing 
Uh-huh 
Well I spent six years in graduate school at in Indiana In the flatlands 
and it was that way every day 
Um 
Rarely a day went by when the wind was less than fifteen or twenty miles an hour Summer and winter 
Um 
so that uh you you became accustomed to it I guess 
Uh-huh 
But uh otherwise w- as I said we have had uh a relatively mild winter speaking for this area of the country 
Uh-huh 
Oh rea- where did you go to school in Indiana 
Purdue 
Purdue 
I have a brother that lives in uh uh South Bend Indiana 
Oh yes 
And I had to always I 've lived there for eight years myself 
I 'd always said I was going to go back to school and go to Notre Dame 
But I did n't Uh 
Well you are not from that area originally I can tell 
No 
originally I 'm from New Mexico 
Oh okay 
I was born in New Mexico 
and we lived in uh South Bend for eighty eight years and uh then moved to uh Tennessee actually 
Uh-huh 
And uh Well I thought I heard a little Tennessee in there somewhere 
Very much 
very much 
cause I I spent thirteen years there And uh then moved to Dallas about three years ago 
Uh-huh 
So Gee 
you 've moved almost moved around as much as I have 
Yeah uh 
my father was in the Air Force 
so Oh I see 
Uh-huh 
Well I worked for the government 
so I I moved uh much more frequently than I had intended for sixteen years 
Uh-huh 
but uh I guess the uh this is my first conversation in this uh uh series 
Oh uh-huh 
I I received a call last night because of the uh I had not received my uh personal identification number 
Right 
So I had to call Jack Godfrey today to ask him what it was because I I had to abort the call last evening because I could n't get on the line 
Yeah 
So uh is there any I 'm not sure how long we 're supposed to talk 
It 's um it 's just as long as you want to 
Oh 
I mean it 's just uh as long as you want to and just you know a reasonable lengthy conversation 
Uh do you work for Texas Instruments 
No 
I do not 
I work for 
Oh okay 
And I uh of course was I was sent a uh an application from uh from Jack 
Uh-huh 
I 've known Jack for some time 
I 'm in the speech processing business and have been for a number of years 
Oh okay 
so I was very much interested in in being a speaker for this 
Yeah 
Well actually I I work for Texas Instruments 
and uh I 'm an a I 'm an environmental engineer 
Oh I see 
and uh they just published this internally you know getting people involved 
Uh-huh 
So that that 's really strange 
I I was wondering why we had somebody from Maryland though 
I was saying God do we have a in Maryland 
or I 'm sure you have a representative somewhere in the area If just nothing more than a business representative or government services representative 
Uh-huh 
and um but I have uh I have been a speaker in other uh similar type of activities 
Uh-huh 
And I know the reason why this is why the uh this is being gathered and the program and so forth 
so I was interested as I said I was interested in being a speaker 
Uh-huh 
We have n't talked much about the weather 
Oh well I know that 's what we 're supposed to do 
Yeah 
yeah 
Well really it uh the letter just says um let 's see I ca n't I was looking at it 
I was trying to find out speedy short cuts 
and I always thought it 's not necessary to measure your time just to go ahead and enjoy the conversation and and end it when needed 
So Uh-huh 
In environmental engineering uh Uh-huh 
is that with regard to work place engineering or just you know environm- the work place environment 
or Uh well it 's actually um waste water 
Oh I see 
Taking taking care of uh I 'm actually in the air division 
and we monitor um anything that comes out of a stack or out of a building 
or um we do have customers that um their concerns are in the work place 
and we take care of that 
but MUMBLEx within our department We take care of everything Waste water uh solid waste and recycling and and air and Uh-huh 
Well I had my the the call last evening was supposed to be about uh concerning recycling in the community 
Oh uh-huh 
The call I received and so I had uh I had thought a little bit about it um before hand 
Uh-huh 
Oh uh-huh 
So I but that that 's interesting 
I have a uh uh friend who is a planner Uh a city planner 
Oh uh-huh 
And one of his and he models uh city districts and so forth uh does computer modeling 
Uh-huh 
Yeah 
And one of the uh he has inputs or gets inputs from uh an environmental engineer MUMBLEx 
Uh-huh 
Yeah 
we actually our division is corporate wide 
and we take care of just the Dallas area 
Uh-huh 
Of course we have several plants here 
but um we do air modeling also 
Oh I see 
And and yeah I take care of all the air modeling specifically for the Dallas area 
What we do we have a weather station that we get all of this information you know temperature wind speed wind direction 
and uh we have a huge chemical data base 
Well that 's interesting 
And uh our our chemical data base so that we know every chemical on site 
and and um its concentration 
and if if anything ever happened God forbid you know a building explosion or something tha- we 'd be able to track chemicals from that building with our weather station 
Okay 
so we 've got to talk about music 
Okay 
And um do you like classic rock or modern rock or which kind 
Oh I guess the stuff that was done more in the seventies because that 's Well no that 's really when I grew up 
No 
not a seventies baby 
so that 's really what I like better 
is that kind of music 
I mean Is it disco 
or is it like No 
no 
no 
not that kind of music 
but No 
more like uh rock um you know like Led Zepplin type 
Oh okay 
So so they can get like the Doors and Led Zepplin 
Right 
Yeah 
that 's cool 
Right 
And how about the Rolling Stones 
Oh sure 
sure 
I went to their concert last year when they were here 
Oh that 's when that 's when they took toured 
How about um Pink Floyd 
Sure 
yeah 
I like them 
Okay 
So so then we got we got some same things 
because Okay 
well I just did n't know that much about music 
and I was n't sure what kind of music 
No 
it 's very hard 
because see well I mean in the whole spectrum I 'd rather listen you know I listen to heavy metal or classic rock 
What what kind of heavy metal are we talking about 
What We 're talking about what they what they call hard rock 
Okay 
like give me some examples 
Like for example let 's see uh Bad Company 
what Oh well Bad Cam- Company 's not bad 
that 's not 
well they 're like for example A 
Yeah 
A 
Why 
have you heard of them 
Yes 
Okay 
And stuff like that 
That 's that 's that 's not really hard rock 
Well okay 
Okay 
I guess I did n't really consider that heavy metal 
Okay 
I mean I I think when you say heavy metal I 'm I 'm thinking about like Cinderella you know 
Well Cinderella is is hard rock heavy metal 
Well see I do n't really care for Cinderella 
But I like A 's okay 
But see for example they have see what but other bands consider it like really hard rock 
It 's like brash metal which all they do is like they have this guitar and they just bang at the guitar 
and the guitar is set like really low 
Yeah 
No 
I do n't really care for that too much I guess 
and what happens is like oh everybody gets like totally into the music 
and then they start dancing around 
Uh-huh 
and they just bump into each other 
Uh-huh 
like like they hit each other with their shoulders 
Uh-huh 
and then you knock people down 
and what you do is you also try to get up on stage and jump down on top of all these other people 
Is that the kind of music that you like 
No 
I do n't like that music 
Oh okay 
But that 's that 's what they do 
That 's that 's what some people call like really heavy metal 
Oh okay 
And see the difference I guess between hard rock and heavy metal is that the lyrics also 
Like really like heavy metal wo- is considered like the words heavy metal 
and like you always thought about like suicide And killing people and stuff like that 
Yeah 
And just hard rock has they they do n't talk about that 
they just talk about like life in general 
Right 
Like Queen 's Reich if you ever heard of them 
Oh sure 
Of course 
Yeah 
Que- you you 're talking Queen 
is that what you said 
Okay 
well no 
I said Queen 's Reich 
but but oh but you got to like Queen also 
Oh oh oh okay 
Right 
So because Well sure 
because Queen was real popular when I was growing up 
Yeah 
especially uh oh God what is it A Night At The Opera 
Do n't they have a no 
let 's see the one that they have the the whole opera singing in the background 
Oh 
Um uh Right 
Bo Bo Bohemian Rhapsody 
right 
yeah 
yeah 
Yeah 
that that was great 
I heard that the other day on the radio 
and I pumped it up 
Because I mean I just love that song 
Yeah 
that that was a real good one 
Yeah 
but they had that that whole record was pretty good 
But then they started going downhill like everybody else 
Well that 's true 
They came up with some pretty weird stuff after that 
Yeah 
they 're they 're still around 
they 've got a ne- new out 
but I I would n't buy it 
Because see what happens is the old see whe- I like I like the old Rolling Stones 
I do n't like the new stuff 
Of the Stones 
Yeah 
Yeah 
I agree 
That 's the ne- the older stuff is the best of it 
The the new stuff 's kind of more like today 's rock and roll which I do n't really care for today 's rock and roll too much 
Yeah 
Well for example I used to like old Phil Collins 
Right 
An old Genesis 
Yes 
definitely 
I agree 
And and then what happened was that Phil Collins said hey I can make money a lot of money doing this 
and then he came out with uh see for example his his record like No Jacket Required 
Uh-huh 
That was good 
but it was on his way of going downhill 
because he said I can make a lot of money just singing alone 
and then he came out with the Invisible Touch with uh Genesis 
and that really like now I hate Phil Collins 
I ca n't stand him 
Right 
Because I look at him 
and I say you know you were singing at this time and with these people 
and you were great 
and now you 're singing all this stuff that does n't matter what you what you sing or what you record 
it 's still going to be a number one hit 
And so that 's that 's what gets me mad 
Yeah 
But did did you go see that new Doors movie 
No 
not yet 
I guess I 've been con- kind of considering it 
Have you seen it yet 
Yeah 
I saw it when it opened 
Was it really good 
Yeah 
Well it it 's you know it 's like I was watching Siskel and Ebert you know like those guys that criticize movies 
Uh-huh 
Right 
And they both loved the movie right 
Uh-huh 
They said the music 's great 
it took me back to the sixties and stuff like that 
Uh-huh 
And then one of them said well everything is great 
but I 'm going to give it thumbs down 
And they go 
but why 
Because it 's like the end is like really depressing 
And so Oh 
But it but it 's like the movie is so well made 
and the music that goes with it just picks you up see I was never I was born in nineteen hundred sixty-nine 
Oh okay 
So I mean so for me So you did n't really grow up with that kind of music then 
No 
but you learn to 
I mean it 's just that like the the sixties music 's got a lot to say 
Right 
I I never found out what a lot of the seventies music had too 
You know I was like Well no 
now well seventies music I mean I 'm like I said yo- disco I do n't like disco 
I 've never liked disco 
Hey 
but I bet you were out there with your bell bottomed pants 
Well that 's true 
That 's true 
But I was more in the late seven- well I shou- like mid to late seventies like between seventy-five and and seventy-nine was more my era 
Yeah 
yeah 
Did did you go to college 
Well no 
I 'm going right now 
Oh that 's cool 
But uh no 
I did n't go then 
But see I graduated high school in seventy-eight 
Okay 
so you know in seventy-eight you know rock was starting to get really heavy you know 
and real um I do n't know 
Yeah 
yeah 
disco was pretty much dead by then 
Yeah 
So so that 's what I mean 
disco was n't really my time 
Well they always say that the seventies was the lowest point in in progression ever in history 
So About music 
No 
about everything 
Oh Okay 
So it 's like nothing happened during the seventies 
Everything happened during the sixties 
the seventies I do n't know what they 're called you know 
it 's like like the the eighties are called like the progressive years or the or you know like the technology years because of all the computers and stuff 
Uh-huh 
But the seventies got nothing 
I mean nobody cared to name it 
That 's kind of funny 
So 
You 're right 
I never thought of that 
The disco years that 's what they 're calling them are gone 
Yeah 
I know 
Can you imagine the like a big picture of John Travolta ta-da what is it 
Him just standing there 
Yeah 
right 
Yeah 
that 's a good example to look for in history 
Well from now on we 're going to go from the from nineteen sixty-nine when they took the first step on the moon to nineteen eighties 
Okay 
what happened in the middle 
Do n't worry 
do n't worry 
you 're not you 're not missing anything you know 
so That 's true 
Well except for Vietnam 
Yeah 
really 
And that 's that 's why I guess everybody You know with yeah 
it 's like they do n't want to talk about that 
so they just do n't name it 
I mean it was it was I guess it was pretty bad times 
Yeah 
Well that 's very true 
But Oh well let 's see 
yeah 
okay 
we 've been talking for seven minutes 
so Oh good 
I have n't even been keeping track 
Okay 
all right 
so um I 'm going to leave you alone 
Uh what what are you doing 
Do you have a family 
Uh yeah 
Okay 
We 're kind of I was kind of in the middle of supper 
but it 's not a big deal 
Oh I 'm sorry 
I just left it 
No 
it 's okay 
because see I did n't see somebody tried to call me last night 
but I did n't have my number yet 
I just got it today 
Oh okay 
And so you know it 's okay 
I I told them I 'd be available during this time 
so anyway 
Okay 
All right 
So then uh have fun doing this 
It is not that bad 
Okay 
thanks 
Bye bye 
Great 
Bye 
Hi Diana 
Hi 
Have you all been able to do much as a family these days 
Pardon me 
Have you all been able to do much as uh as a full family these days all of you 
Oh yes 
we 've uh been um we 've gone other you know all kinds of places 
we go out to dinner 
Yeah 
we take the kids to the park 
and uh you know whenever we he my husband has time off or something we take them to the zoo 
or we you know we do everything we can possibly as a family 
Do you work outside the home 
No 
I do n't 
Yeah 
I do n't either 
it makes it a little bit easier I think that way 
Yeah 
it does 
an an then uh you know my husband enjoys spending time with the kids you know 
he 'll he 'll take them out just to be with them 
Yeah 
So he they can have time with him an 
So you have a break too 
Right 
so and we uh we try to teach our kids as much as we can at home you know we have we try to spend like Monday nights we call it family home evening and have our kids uh you know have little lessons with them and you know just see count see how things are going in our family and you know teach them about their grandparents or something like that Bring out pictures of them so they get to know them 
Uh-huh 
and we just do all kinds of fun things like that 
an Yeah 
we have family that 's far away 
It sounds like you might too 
Yeah 
we do 
so they you know the only way they know their grandparents is by pictures 
Yeah 
And uh Right 
and phone calls that 's about about it 
Yeah 
right 
and uh you know they we you know we go to the park 
or we go in the backyard and sit down 
an That 's wha- yeah that 's what we mostly do pretty simple things 
Yeah 
Especially since my youngest one is excuse me only fourteen months 
Right 
She she 's really getting to the age where she 's playing and likes to go places 
Uh-huh 
Yeah 
and with you know me being at home and just having the one income you know you do n't have this lot of extra money to to do a lot of you know extra things 
That 's right 
So you you make more fun than you know You know the kids just think it 's wonderful just maybe to go get an ice cream cone or yeah or uh you know go get a bag of and 's or something like that 
Oh that 's a big thrill for them 
they they think that 's a lot of fun 
So we just we try to spend as much time as we can 
We you know our our whole weekends are divi- are devoted to our children except for we might go out you know one evening or something 
Yeah 
but during the day you know it 's all devoted to our kids 
and they come go to church with us 
and so Yeah 
that 's true 
Yeah 
so Have um have you ever been to the Science it 's called the Science Place 
Yes 
yes 
that 's what We ju- we have n't lived here too long 
and we went there a couple of weeks ago 
and uh Uh-huh 
the kids thought that was wonderful 
Oh yeah 
we I guess there 's Science Place One and Science Place Two 
We 've only been in I think it 's Science Place Two 
I is I 'm not sure which one we went into 
it was about a year or so ago when we went 
The one we went in had uh the thing that sticks out most in my mind is that like a kid 's place area 
Uh-huh 
yeah 
That really seem they really seemed to go wild in there 
Yeah 
yeah 
they had a lot of fun in there 
and uh there 's uh there 's some petting you know like uh uh I think it 's Owens Country Farms has a free petting you know like a farm that you can go to 
and the kids can pet animals and stuff 
Where 's that 
That 's on Plano Road 
uh it 's like in Richardson you go up Plano Road 
it 's like a little bit past Campbell and Plano Road 
Uh-huh 
uh-huh 
And that 's a lot of fun 
Oh yeah 
They have tours going through there 
and uh the kids think that was a lot of fun too 
Oh that does sound like fun 
It 's a little bit of a ways 
We take you know whenever we take them to Showbiz or they think it 's wonderful just to go to McDonald 's you know 
they do n't go for the food 
they go for the to play around 
and There 's another place in Mesquite called Monkey Business 
That 's right 
Uh-huh 
and it 's a indoor fun park 
and it has a bunch of different rides for kids 
That 's sounds fun too 
And parents get in free 
and it 's like during the week 
it 's like five dollars admission per child all day 
And and you said about Plano and Campbell is the petting 
The petting farm 
yeah 
That sounds fun 
I think maybe we 'll try to do that 
Yeah 
yeah 
and the one in Mesquite is uh Scyene exit 
Uh-huh 
And it 's it 's uh the kids just had a wonderful time there 
they you know you just pay that admission 
and then all the the the rides are free 
You know of course they have all the little video games and you know those little quarter rides you know to and stuff like that 
but they thought that was lot of fun 
Yeah 
You can have birthday parties there 
an I think that was better than like Showbiz Pizza cause there 's more for them to do 
Because they can just do you do n't have to have tokens for everything 
Yeah 
right 
Yeah 
So they had a lot of fun 
That does sound like fun 
Well I 've gotten some good ideas from you 
Yeah 
I we try to do a lot of things as a family and you know inexpensively as possible 
so Definitely 
Well I think I do n't know if we 've done five minutes 
but I 'm sure that will be good 
Yeah 
that will be good 
yeah 
It was good talking to you 
Well it was good talking to you 
I really appreciate your suggestions 
Oh no problem 
Well take care 
Okay 
bye-bye 
Bye-bye 
Okay uh 
my favorite show is 
and it has been for a long time 
but I feel almost ashamed to say that to anybody now because I have never met anybody who likes it 
Do you by any chance 
Oh yes 
You do 
Yes 
very much 
Well would n't you know 
As a matter of fact I prefer public television 
Uh-huh 
And uh I have particularly enjoy the English comedies and the English mysteries 
Yeah 
Yeah 
I watch mysteries too 
Is that what you 're referring to 
Yes 
Okay 
yeah 
That is good 
I like uh do you read 
Vociferously 
Okay 
well that 's the reason why I like both of those programs is because they 're kind of based on books 
Yes 
And the plots are more um challenging you know than the sitcoms of regular 
Well unfortunately for us at least here in the United States we the only access we have to that of course is public television 
Yeah 
I 'm I 'm not a great television watcher in any respect 
but uh the watching what I do watch is uh usually news and whatever is on public television 
Any kind of I also uh am very fond of great performances in that regard 
Uh-huh 
yeah 
Me too 
But uh Did you stay up late and catch this 
No 
Oh that was a scream 
no 
no 
as a matter of fact uh Turner Broadcasting has been uh broadcasting all of the James Bond movies every night this week 
Uh-huh 
Really 
so I have concentrated on watching James Bond movies this week 
I used to like him too 
he was my hero 
In fact I like Sean Connery to this day 
Well they 're showing uh at this moment 
Yeah 
and it is the first appearance of Roger Moore as double oh seven 
Yeah 
So Oh he can never cut it 
No 
no 
that 's true 
I was just thinking that today he did well in some of the later movies he looks very effeminate in his early movies 
Yeah 
Yeah 
yeah 
he does 
Whereas uh Sean Connery has maintained the uh how would you uh ruddy look 
but uh Oh yes 
Uh-huh 
yeah 
I liked his accent too 
And he can even be in movies that are not uh uh sexually oriented 
and he still comes off great 
Well you know he was when was it last year or year before last he was voted the sexiest actor in movies or something 
He is 
Yeah 
he had my vote double 
I mean the man is sixty-two years old 
I do n't care 
But uh but otherwise you know we uh with and so forth And I I particularly enjoy I do n't know whether you 've had a chance to watch it on but uh the series uh 
Yeah 
Oh what 's that about 
That was about a the Interior Minister 
it was a comedy 
Oh yeah 
yeah 
the Interior Minister of in England with the permanent secretary and bureaucracy and all that 
Uh-huh 
Right 
Right 
I I 've seen it several times 
It 's a scream 
but I have to go to bed 
I have to get up and and work the next morning 
I wish they 'd put those that 's why I say did you stay up late to watch this 
It came on after on Saturday nights here at least 
Uh-huh 
And it should of course I li- really it was I do n't think they should show it during prime time 
but still it was funny 
Yeah 
Yeah 
I know 
Well I I I 'm not much of a television watcher 
I I read as I said and uh quite a bit 
Uh-huh 
I read about two or three novels a week in addition to all the technical stuff 
Yeah 
What what do you do 
What kind of work do you do 
I 'm a Payroll Clerk 
Just an accounting clerk 
At I 
No uh 
I have a friend who works for I 
and I work for a tire service here in Oh I see 
I 'm from Dallas 
Uh-huh 
Well the last two people who have called both worked for I 
and I just wondered 
Yeah 
yeah 
it could be I -ers I think probably are participating more than anybody else 
but I needed the money 
This is five bucks here 
I think that 's something we all ca- Yeah 
really 
Do you work for I 
No 
no 
I work for In Maryland 
Really 
yes 
How did you hear oh we 're not even supposed to be talking about this though are we 
I guess not 
How did I hear about it 
Well I work you know they are gathering a data base for voice processing 
Uh-huh 
And that 's my field of work also 
Oh 
So I I know the people at I who are doing this 
and I heard about it 
so I called them and asked if I could participate And uh You know send in the forms et cetera and uh so forth 
Oh 
Right 
We could go back to television shows 
Well you know speaking of public have you caught any of this series on the Bible 
Yes 
I have 
I 've heard that it 's really against the well I mean that it 's coming out with the idea that the Bible 's not true 
Well no 
That 's uh you could interpret it that way 
Uh-huh 
Uh I I think what they are trying to say is that there is a great deal of historical truth 
but the interpretation that actually got into the writing of the Bible itself is probably uh after the what uh was is it the King James Version when the committee did it wrote the translation that so much was lost in the translation particularly since most of the translations were in Greek 
Yeah 
Well for example In Greek there are seven different words for love 
Right 
Okay 
so you can have there 's one word for love of your brother one word for love of your wife one word for you know uh love of your father and that sort of thing 
So in as to those types of interpretations uh really made a difference in how one might interpret the Bible now and what it 's at 
Uh-huh 
So that 's you know you can look at it as though they are saying it 's not true 
but there 's too much historical fact involved just from the uh the histories that are were developed around that time that are available To deny that at least the majority of it is true 
Yeah 
So you know it depends on how you look at it 
Yeah 
You can look at it you know if you want to say that it 's proven that it is n't true then you can very much look at it that way 
I guess if you 're looking for that you 're Yeah 
well Well you can interpret that the what the show in the same way that you can interpret the Bible 
that uh Uh-huh 
So Really 
But uh as as far as that goes I we at least agree on what we enjoy 
Yeah 
that 's right 
But uh I do n't know if there is there is a time limit on this so uh Yeah 
Surely we 've made it 
I think so too 
Let 's just it 's been very pleasant talking to you 
It was very nice talking to you 
and have a good evening 
You too 
Good night 
Bye-bye 
Uh well how is it appropriate to be talking about exercise attitudes 
We uh well uh my my husband is right now teaching an aerobics class 
Uh-huh 
He 's an aerobics instructor And um is going to be uh entering North Texas for uh a Kinesiology program there 
Uh-huh 
And um the the how I met him was through uh the aerobics class that he used to teach 
Uh-huh 
You 're a student 
Yeah 
so I 'm I 'm an avid aerobics uh person and just very very athletic 
Uh-huh 
Enjoying a th- you know uh anything dealing with sports 
Uh-huh 
uh-huh 
So and how do you feel about it 
Uh I 'm I am a person who wishes I had more time to exercise 
I I do n't feel like I I do n't very often do things for the sake of exercise 
I do n't feel well unless I am exercising 
and I try to do things that involve exercise 
but I very rarely do things like um I 've never done aerobics or any sort of structured 
this is my exercise time 
Uh-huh 
but I do lots of outdoor sports and things bicycling uh you know mountaineering a little mountaineering this and that 
and I spend a lot of time 
and I probably get more exercise than your average person 
But it 's not a a structured sort of thing 
and I have to admit I have a certain resistance to the idea of exercising for exercising 's sake 
Uh-huh 
and perhaps it 's because somehow that implies to me it 's not fun or something like that 
Yeah 
well I I 've my that 's the way my mother stands on it 
She feels like if it 's something that you have to do you know if you look at it as if you have to do it then it becomes it becomes a chore 
Uh-huh 
Uh-huh 
Yes 
yes 
and and she does n't enjoy it when it 's a chore 
So um and I feel that way too as far as you know just sitting and doing you know to the idea of doing fifty sit-ups or something you know 
to Uh-huh 
uh-huh 
you 're a calcu- you know 
calculated down 
and do your calisthenics you know three times a week 
Uh-huh 
or but but I do try and um I do try and regulate how much exercise I get a week 
Uh-huh 
uh-huh 
Yeah 
yeah 
Is that why you like aerobics classes because you 're not sort of someone else is doing the counting for you so it makes it less of a chore 
Yeah 
And it 's got and I 've always enjoyed dance 
Yeah 
So it involves you know I I ca n't get out to dance all the time 
and Yeah 
would that we could 
Yeah 
and it 's and it 's more regulated 
I mean you 're you 're using different parts of the body 
Uh-huh 
uh-huh 
So it it is like dance 
an- and it 's structured like that 
but you have the music and someone like you said someone else is counting so it makes it easier for me 
Yeah 
Uh-huh 
And someone else is telling me okay you know let 's move this way let 's move that way instead of me having to think about it so much 
Uh-huh 
uh-huh 
Right 
You can just trust someone else to give you full exercise 
and all you do is follow along and enjoy yourself 
Yeah 
yeah 
But I 'm like you 
I also um like to participate in uh things like well we just went to the uh Myererson Symphony Run this past weekend 
and and that was a lot of fun 
and you get to meet different people and um just get out you know out and about 
Uh-huh 
uh-huh 
Uh-huh 
uh-huh 
and it 's it it 's something you can all like our we did it as a family 
so it was it was quite a lot of fun 
Uh-huh 
Uh-huh 
and biking and I I I love to swim 
so I love it when you know it 's swimming weather 
Um 
and uh Well you 're talking to someone from California where it 's often swimming weather 
Oh 
I did n't realize that 
Uh 
I 'm sorry 
Well I 'm in Texas 
I I just assumed that I had this is the first call I 've done 
Uh-huh 
and I did n't realize that they ha- were going to reach out to people from all over the country 
You would n't know that 
Oh I So it 's the it 's it 's the the act- well it 's actually it 's interesting because there are re- real regional differences 
Um in California there 's uh almost an assumption um unless you 're sort of clearly of an older generation or something you know in your sixties or something like that 
I 'm I 'm I 'm not Uh 
there 's an assumption that you do something for your physical fitness and and at least in urban California 
And maybe not I do n't know about rural California too well 
But in urban California it 's just you know for all I know aerobics started out here 
I do n't know where they actually started 
but they you know the craze really picked up big here 
and before that there was the running craze 
And they California gets you know tends to be a bit faddish 
but the remarkable thing is how well the fads catch on elsewhere 
Uh-huh 
So there must be something to some of them 
And uh Well I think people are are more inc- um um people from California seem to be more health motivated all around I mean as far as the diet and everything Uh the diet and uh just your health consciousness 
and I mean it just seems like uh a lot of those ideas generate out of California 
Uh-huh 
Not just exercise but health health related ideas 
Yeah 
And I it 's curious I do n't know why do n't know if it 's do you does California have a Well there 's a sense of it being a package 
I think There there is a sense of you know whole there 's a lot of you know you 'll get organizations like institutes for the whole health or whatever 
And uh oh the the the uni- University of California at Berkeley puts out Which is uh turned into a fairly well subscribed to uh newsletter monthly or biweekly newsletter or something like that 
Uh-huh 
and and it does n't deal with just exercise or just stress management or just diet or anything 
It it 's on fairly so- solid scientific ground 
Uh it 's just dispensed with these distinctions 
It says ever- all sorts of factors go into health and there 's no reason to talk about one rather than another so that they they combined them all together 
And uh so it 's had that orientation for quite some time 
Um there 's been some progressive medical schools out here that have taken that approach 
Uh-huh 
And um Now do you think that 's because they 've realized that for whole health that the you know you have to have that combination or that people are motivated that way so that they 've incorporated that into their program 
Boy 
Do you think the program came first or the yeah 
that there 's a I I can say there 's a correlation but I could n't say which which caused the other 
They sort of dev- you know each developed a little bit and then would feed off one another and develop a little bit more and a little bit more 
Yeah 
the more money they put into it 
Yeah 
And I can see that 
And cause I knowing from institutes of learning like that I know that they 've got to get their money somewhere 
and somebody 's got to be willing to pay for it and believe in it 
so Yeah 
yeah 
Exactly 
And part of it is California you know in back in the sixties had a lot of alternative movements 
and some of them fizzled out 
and some of them were disastrous 
and others of them um had an impact on the society around here 
And one of the ones that had an impact was uh people becoming interested in alternate practices 
I 'm not sure if it was a meditation practice or if it was you know which is similar to a stress management practice or alternates to uh A A approved medicine 
Uh you have you know major um acupuncture schools and things out here 
And and you could have them around long enough 
and more and more people start believing them or wondering how to combine them with other things 
Uh-huh 
and before long you you get this this whole kind of Gestalt this whole package of of health of health care and options 
Uh-huh 
and uh and exercise is is strongly considered one of them 
The irony is is it 's people in the cities in my experience that are most oriented towards doing the exercise 
And I guess because they spend all day in back of their desks 
The average person out on the farm at least traditionally now they drive fancy tractors as much as anything but at least traditionally the laborers Yeah 
last thing Or they 're older 
Pardon me 
Well do n't you think they tend to be older in the rural ar- I I sometimes think that it 's almost frantic effort on the part of the people in the city 
Oh like everything else 
I live in a rural area 
so you know I see that 
Yeah 
yeah 
The rat race to exercise 
It 's yeah it 's it 's like it 's frantic to you know to uh achieve something that that a person in a rural area uh almost does n't worry about it to such a degree but stays you know almost healthier you know 
Uh-huh 
Yeah 
well I I think so 
as a fit person 
I mean you you 've if you look at cert- if you look at other cultures like I know a little bit about people who were considered very healthy in China 
and they do n't do very much vigorous exercise at all 
But they do a lot of low keyed low impact low stress exercise 
and they combine it with a you know meditation or whatever Some sort of relaxation 
Uh-huh 
and they seem pretty you know they do n't have the hard body 
They do n't have that perfect look 
and an awful lot of exercise is sort of image conscious 
But they you know they live to a hundred and ten some you know 
Yeah 
And that that 's Well do n't you think a lot of that is diet too 
and a lot of that is diet 
That 's true 
Yeah 
Yeah 
I mean they eat they eat a lot of carbohydrates and not much fat Um for economical reasons not for preference 
Uh-huh 
Um Yeah 
and as we can see Well I 'm a I 'm a practicing vegetarian 
so uh I 've read a lot of information knowing that to be true 
Yeah 
am I actually What 's that 
I as am I 
Oh are you also 
Yes 
Well that 's that 's good as far as the cal- is that is that um pretty predominant as far as California do- doe- It is in the urban areas 
yes 
In the urban areas 
Most for example most restaurants in an urban area will have a little vegetarian section now 
Uh-huh 
Oh that 's wonderful 
Well most most mo- sort of modern looking restaurants will 
Yeah 
you can That 's great 
I mean we uh it 's such a chor- it 's such a trouble here 
I mean you just have to eat at home basically 
I was wondering that 
because I was actually applying for a job in Texas 
and and and uh it occurred to me Well of course in the cities yeah 
well in the cities we live close to Dallas 
Uh-huh 
so uh which you know you get uh an influx of a lot of people from all over the country 
so you 're going to have a lot of di- more choices 
Uh-huh 
uh-huh 
but but in urban areas it 's you know steak places 
Yeah 
Yeah 
an and it 's not a you know Yeah 
it 's uh it 's definitely it it 's it 's changing to a degree 
but um it 's very frustrating And even even with health food stores and stores where you can buy natural products or uh organic you know materials and foods and things 
Yeah 
Uh-huh 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
You do n't really have that 
I mean you would think All right um 
I think the topic was crime in the city 
Right 
I do not live in a city 
I live in a real small little place 
Where is that 
Uh it 's about thirty miles from Sherman 
North south east or west 
It 's north of Sherman 
Well you live almost in Oklahoma 
Not too far 
Yeah 
That 's kind of ironic because I do n't live too far from Oklahoma either 
Huh-uh 
You know where Saint Joe is 
Uh I 've been through there 
I 'm about eight miles south of it 
Okay 
Oh yeah 
I had been through Saint Joe 
but um just as far as watching the news and reading the papers and all that it sounds like the crimes in the cities are really getting bad 
Well you know I 've I 've seen those statistics and everything 
and you know what frightens me is that you put a half a million people out in the middle of the desert with high tech weaponry you know 
Huh-uh 
I mean the Iraqis did n't have a lot of high-tech weaponry 
but they had mortars and machine guns tanks and all that 
Oh yeah 
Sure 
And they did n't kill as many people in in forty-five days 
and they were intending to kill people 
Huh-uh 
I mean that was their job as they killed in Washington 
Oh I know 
I know 
I know 
Um I think nowadays people just really just murder is nothing to them you know 
Well I formulated a pretty radical theory over the last ten years I guess 
And I 've come to the conclusion and this is a pretty scary thought to me even that if a guy is convicted or a gal is convicted of a crime rather than put them in prison because prison 's proven not to work just let them go 
Say okay you 're convicted 
Huh-uh 
and just let them go 
Yeah 
and if they get convicted again well just kill them 
Yeah 
because uh most likely that will happen wo n't it that you know Well I think that the best hope to eliminate crime as we know it today is to eliminate the criminals from society 
Huh-uh 
Huh-uh 
If someone is known to have been in prison they ca n't get a job 
No 
You know 
Yeah 
They ca n't be accepted into society 
You know if they 're not going to be accepted into society then everybody 's going to become sociopathic 
Huh-uh 
And you know who 's to put the limit on it 
I mean I was watching a thing last night up in Washington State 
If you get convicted of uh sexual offenses on a regular basis You know I mean some of these guys are forty years old and got ten convictions 
Huh-uh 
And they 're still let out on the street after one or two years 
Well in Washington State if you 're a habitual sexual offender they just do n't let you out 
Um 
So you serve your prison term 
and then you go into the mental hospital 
and if you 're pronounced cured they 'll let you go 
Huh-uh 
Well they may find a cure for it 
but there is no known cure now 
Um So you 're you 're kind of thinking in other words if you get if you do something the first time that 's not real bad you know 
Hey people make mistakes 
yeah 
to go ahead and let them go 
but if they do it again and they really need to face the consequences then uh Well yeah 
use that 
or you know there 's other consequences rather than killing them you know 
you could always make them the slave of the people they committed the crime against 
Oh 
Huh-uh 
You know 
Yeah 
At least they might get some benefit in that 
and if the people they committed a crime against feel at some later date that these people have learned their lesson are are okay you know well they can free them 
Huh-uh 
But uh you know with the technology we have today you can put a collar on a guy 's leg that will knock him down if they leave the property 
I mean it will just in incapacitate them 
Huh-uh 
And you can put a collar around a guy 's leg that will prohibit them from committing any kind of prohibitive act 
Huh-uh 
But you know putting them in prison my God that does n't work 
No 
apparently not 
because look how many years they 've been doing that 
and look 
I mean yeah 
Well you look at places like Turkey 
Turkey has the death penalty for just about everything 
Huh-uh 
Huh-uh 
I mean if you get convicted of uh you know drug trafficking they just kill you 
You get convicted of uh you know heinous crimes they just kill you 
I mean there 's no two ways about it 
Huh-uh 
And uh you look at their society 
and the repeat offenders are very few 
You know and you look at our society almost everyone out on the street that has been in prison has been in prison three or four times 
Three or four times 
yeah 
I mean You know the way to stop that kind of behavior is is two-fold 
That is true 
I know 
Yeah 
One you need to make it illegal for both parents to work while the kids are under seven 
I I think that 's very important 
Oh I 'm I agree very much so on that 
I yeah 
And then if a parent has proved to be unfit for any reason take the kids away from the parents 
Huh-uh 
Yeah 
Because you know we are what we teach 
Huh-uh 
Because that 's what our society becomes 
We have We have just a bunch of people 
comes 
yeah 
and I 've and I 've I 've lived in that that environment for quite a few years when I was doing construction work 
You know and these guys they come to work every morning 
and they 're stoned to the bone 
I mean they 're so high they could fly up to the top of that building 
and they work all day 
and they go home 
and they smoke their dope and drink their booze and shoot their drugs 
and when they run out of money they go down to the corner store and pop the guy on the head and take his money 
and then they go back to work on Monday 
Huh-uh 
And the kids of these people MUMBLEx 
Sure 
they just think that 's the normal thing to do do n't they 
They 're sociopathic 
Yeah 
And I worked in a first grade classroom for one full semester 
Huh-uh 
and these kids were more foulmouthed than I 've ever been 
I had one kid threaten my life Threaten my life 
In the first grade 
Told me that daddy 's going to whoop me to death 
Oh know 
You know and they flipping me the finger and all that 
Huh-uh 
and I just said to this kid I said you got two choices kid 
you can step into mainstream society 
or you can die 
Huh-uh 
Because you will eventually be killed 
And I just I 'm just totally aghast at a what 's going on 
Oh I know 
I know um 
I work in school You know 
that 's something I do 
and I it really is I 'm like you 
astonishing what the younger ages know 
and they react to what they see at home You know 
Huh-uh 
If they see violence at home that 's what you 're going to get from the kids at school 
Exactly 
You know It really is 
and that 's kind of sad 
Well you can see it in the work place you know 
Used to be when you had a personality conflict you just you worked with it 
and you got through it 
Huh-uh 
Now you know people get fired 
or what 's even worse is they promote them into a position that they ca n't handle and let them get fired 
Yeah 
Or one thing or the other 
You look at another kind of society like the Japanese 
You put that many people on that small of a space they 've learned to live together 
Okay 
It 's in their culture 
Huh-uh 
And one of the things that 's in their culture that I really think the major corporations should pay attention to is the fact that while Japan was becoming a great power financially the people that worked for those companies worked for the same company they worked for at sixty-five as they did when they were eighteen 
Teen 
And the company took it upon itself to find a position for these people 
If they were n't fit for the job they were hired for they did n't just can them 
they made a position for them some where 
Huh-uh 
You look at Frito Lay 
My wife used to work for Frito Lay as a typist 
You know transcribing stuff into the computer 
Huh-uh 
Well she could type about one-hundred and five words per minute 
but she do n't like it 
She just does n't like to do that 
I mean she will 
Yeah 
But you know her preference is to be in an office situation where her job is Um what kind of hobbies do you have 
Um I do a lot of cross-stitching and painting when I do have spare time 
Really 
I like cross-stitch too 
Oh I love it 
I just have a hard time finding any spare time lately 
That 's my case also 
I 've got a new born 
and there 's just no time 
Uh-huh 
Have you been cross-stitching long 
Oh several years 
My husband is even interested in it now 
He likes to help me design um you know projects that are a little more customized 
Oh really 
Mine sort of he looks at the pattern 
and he says how do you get that from there to the material 
Not that hard 
Oh it 's not 
I really enjoy it 
And once you get started on it it 's just oh I just I love it 
Uh-huh 
I do a lot of my own patterns also 
Yeah 
In fact I did one you know from Glenn County that uh was a real good one to do 
Oh yeah 
It was tough 
but uh yeah 
Do you have any others 
or is this mainly cross-stitching 
Um I do mostly that um 
not very artistic really for like painting and stuff 
Oh uh-huh 
Um Yeah 
But now I do n't know 
I 'm still trying to get all the colors 
Oh really 
Yeah 
I 've got the kits to put them all in 
I do n't have them all yet certainly 
Yeah 
right 
Yeah 
Yeah 
I got to counting the other day 
and uh I think I have what was it two hundred 
and I got to thinking the money that I 've got invested in this is uh it yeah it can add up quick 
Oh yeah 
I just I just keep an inventory of what I currently have 
and then when I start a new project I go through and see if I if I you know just buy the colors that I need of what I 'm low on 
Uh-huh 
Right 
I see 
Well now can I improvise with adding and using another color instead you know what comes close Because a lot of them are similar 
Uh-huh 
Yeah 
A lot of times you can do that 
I think I the pinks there 's like forty-two different shades of pink 
Good grief 
Yeah 
there 's lots of pinks and greens 
Pinks and greens 
Yeah 
There 's lots of shades of greens 
But the colors I just love all the different colors 
Yeah 
They had quite a few new ones come out last year that they added to 
But you do n't have much spare time either 
Well not lately 
I just started a new job and trying to get acclimated there 
Oh yes 
And that does take some time 
And if we 're trying to get acclimated with the uh with having a baby 
and MUMBLEx Yeah 
How old 
He 's seven months old 
Oh yeah 
And just into everything 
so there 's not a spare moment 
Oh but I would n't trade it for the world 
I 've been trying to do some bibs for him And uh work on his Christmas stocking 
Oh yeah 
Yeah 
We missed it last year 
so hopefully this year he 'll have one 
Yeah 
Well last year he was a little bit young for having one 
Right 
He would n't have enjoyed it anyway 
MUMBLEx You would have 
but Right 
If it tasted good yeah 
All he liked was the lights this year 
so Oh yeah 
Oh well that 's neat that you like cross-stitching also 
Yeah 
that 's that 's kind of strange that we got the same call 
Yeah 
It 's a MUMBLEx call 
Oh I 'm sorry 
Go ahead 
No 
that 's okay 
Okay uh 
but yeah 
I 've been doing it for probably ten years or so 
Oh wow 
No 
I just started about well five years ago I think 
But it is peaceful 
I mean it is relaxing to do once you find the time to do it 
Uh-huh 
There 's also a couple of large projects baby afghans 
and I got one done 
and I think the other one is going The child is going to be in high school before I get finished 
On that uh Bear thing 
is it one of those afghans that I 've seen in the packages with the with the large squares 
Well yeah 
I just I bought the cloth and the pattern for it 
I did n't um I did n't buy the uh I did n't buy a kit 
Oh uh-huh 
Well I 've seen the afghans in the stores that are designed for cross-stitching 
Uh-huh 
It 's that cloth 
Oh okay 
It 's an- cloth I think 
Uh-huh 
And it has the borders and everything already 
Yeah 
Those are pretty 
Number one turned out just great 
and the lady said she could n't believe that they know that I had done it in the colors that they had decorated the nursery 
and I did n't even know it 
Oh that 's a MUMBLEx I gave it to her 
and she said how did you know those are the colors we used 
I said did n't 
That was a good MUMBLEx It worked out that way 
That 's great 
Uh that uh now I 've got the material to do an afghan that I just never did get around to finishing it 
Uh-huh 
I like those 
Those are pretty 
Yeah 
Lilly Lilly she said she said it 's for your daughter to use 
Oh no 
She said I know she does n't get to touch it 
She hung it on the wall 
Yes 
my uh grandmother um made us a couple of quilts for the baby 
and I was like oh I do n't want to mess those up 
Yeah 
Uh they 're just too nice 
I mean you do n't get many hand made quilts anymore 
Yeah 
Oh yeah 
True 
Well I 've enjoyed this 
Okay 
But uh well keep up the good um 
keep up the cross-stitching 
You too 
All right 
thanks 
Uh-huh 
bye bye 
Bye bye 
Okay 
The topic is to discuss the uh sources where I receive news 
Uh-huh 
And uh for me that 's mostly newspaper and radio 
I almost never watch television as a matter of course 
so I do n't get news from television 
except during the war I watched a lot of because it was so good 
Uh-huh 
Well why was the only of course I think Saddam Hussein only allowed to broadcast it 
is that not true 
Um 
It was unusual not to have the different sources you know of news coverage 
Yeah 
Um I do n't know 
I guess uh I do n't even know why I watched 
I guess I just wanted more news 
It 's one of the few times I wanted more news than Yeah 
well I know even if you watched A or the other 
I mean what 's the other one uh 
They all were were tapped into 
Were they 
Uh-uh 
Yeah 
That 's the only thing they broadcast 
and like you I listened to radio on my job at work 
Uh-huh 
And all this week they have been having this uh a discussion about that is why uh why was well I listen to a Christian radio station 
Uh-huh 
And they were saying that is definitely a world uh news service 
and uh they it was you ca n't really be sure of the quality of what you 've got you know 
Huh 
Uh we had some uh some people from our church went to Israel uh just for a uh tour sort of thing 
Uh-huh 
And I was watching on 
they they broadcast this terrible riot 
supposedly that was going on in Jerusalem 
so we got all fearful for our people come to find out they came back and said they were n't even aware of it 
Right 
and so it really made me question as to what how do we know you know uh if the news we 're getting is any good 
So Yeah 
I guess the news just focuses on major events that probably do n't affect ninety-nine percent of the people who are right there when the news is being made 
Yeah 
Right 
right 
But uh I I 'm from California 
and I can remember being in uh in these earthquakes 
and I mean they were they were very minor kinds of things from my point of view and it seemed you know from anyone else 's point of view 
Yeah 
but they get all blown up in the news Um 
Uh-huh 
Well I I find it depressing to watch our specially you know it 's just uh local news concentrates on murders and things like that 
I 'm from Dallas 
and uh we have a lot of bad stuff uh 
it just really gets me depressed even to watch it 
Uh-huh 
Uh-huh 
Yeah 
So then you wake up one morning 
and you are in war with somebody 
you do n't even even know about it 
Right 
So Well what newspapers uh do you read in Dallas 
Uh we have the and the 
but I do n't I do n't read newspapers 
Do n't you 
Huh-uh 
How come 
Uh-huh 
I find it hard to uh follow from one page to another 
It 's just something I have never developed uh an interest in 
Huh 
And I live in kind of a bad area where if I have the paper delivered it 's stolen before I can get out and get it 
Gosh that 's that sounds pretty bad to me 
I mean who would steal a newspaper 
You would be surprised 
Huh 
They just come by and pick them up even if it 's just for the you know t- uh selections of the day 
I see 
I do n't know 
It just would n't be there whenever I tried it 
Yeah 
So you 're right 
who would steal a newspaper 
But they do 
Yeah 
What part of California are you from 
Uh from Los Angeles 
but I live in Raleigh North Carolina right now 
that 's where I am speaking to you from 
Oh okay 
But I grew up in A 
I work out here 
Huh you work for I 
No 
I do n't 
I work for North Carolina State University 
Huh 
But uh I know some people at I 
and I have a couple of students who have graduated and gone to work for them 
Yeah 
So I 'm in the computer business 
Well I boy current events is not a good subject for me 
Well I do n't keep up with it that often 
Let 's see I 've I 've I 've never done this before 
I mean I 've never This is your first call 
This is my first call Because I just got my password 
Oh really 
Yeah 
So I do n't know 
are we suppose to it seems to me it says you are suppose to talk for three minutes 
but I think we 've been talking for three minutes 
and nobody has interrupted 
Yeah 
well I I got into a conversation last night with a lady 
and they interrupt at ten minutes 
I see 
So if we 've done our three minutes Let 's just let the conversation end and say bye 
Uh-huh 
Well all right 
Nice talking to you 
Nice talking to you too 
All right 
bye 
Bye-bye 
Hello 
Hello 
Hey how you doing 
Not bad 
not bad 
What 's your name 
Fernando 
Fernando 
My name is Nick 
Wait 
Let me turn off my stereo here 
Sure 
Because I 've been like waiting like for about ten minutes to get connected to somebody 
Really 
Yeah 
Phew 
Man I 'm Yeah 
What time is it over th- 
are you are you in Dallas 
No 
no 
I 'm in Detroit 
Or not Detroit I 'm in uh California 
Are you 
Yeah 
I Because every time I got through I went to Dallas Texas 
Really 
Yeah 
I 'm in North Carolina 
Oh 
Well you 're on the uh let 's see 
On the other coast 
Yeah 
twenty-one 
Yeah 
Shoot man it 's what midnight almost 
What 
Yeah 
yeah 
It 's uh I 'm watching here 
Yeah 
okay 
All right 
Well I guess we 're supposed to talk 
what about 
credit card 
wait 
Wh- what did how how did you get to know about the I thing 
Oh one of my instructors uh said that they were doing something like this 
and Wha- what are you working on 
A a Masters in uh information systems 
Really 
I 'm doing my Masters in in computer science and computer engineering 
Yeah 
Where at 
At North Carolina State University 
Hey 
How do you like it out there 
Uh I do n't Because uh I come from a lot a bigger city than this one 
and I I 'm in Raleigh 
Yeah 
and Oh 
Raleigh Durham 
Yeah 
Yeah 
That area 
And it 's really small 
All all you have is like towns built around universities 
Uh-huh 
Like Chapel Hill 
Yeah 
So it it 's basically a bunch of small towns anyway 
Kind of quaint little towns 
but they do n't have a whole lot there 
Yeah 
Where you at 
Uh well I 'm in Monterey California right now 
Yeah 
Oh okay 
So so I mean it 's like this this town probably has like two hundred and fifty thousand people 
and that 's about it 
Two hundred fifty 
Yeah 
Okay 
It it 's it 's a lot bigger than Monterey is 
But we 're just uh just south of uh San Jose and San Francisco 
Oh okay 
And it 's only a couple of hours away or a hour away to a you know to a large city 
So so where do you go 
Do you go to Berkeley 
No 
no 
I go to the it 's the naval postgraduate school out here 
Oh okay 
Because uh I was looking at at the doctorate degree in computer science center at Berkeley 
Uh-huh 
And they 're asking like for a uh A of like three point seven or something like that 
Uh-huh 
And like they 're looking like for uh like ninety-nine percentile and this and that 
Yeah 
And it 's like Well that 's what they look for 
Whether or not they get it is hard to say 
Yeah 
I know 
That 's why that 's why I did n't apply 
I mean it was like for me it was like practically impossible to get between like ninety and ninety-nine percentile on the on the verbal part 
Yeah 
Yeah 
It 's pretty tough 
It 's pretty tough 
I uh let 's face it you know 
And you know I you know did the you know as far as I found it a lot of times with regards to education you know the school only takes you so far you know 
It 's what you do You know 
Yeah 
So uh I do n't lose any sleep sleep over stuff like that 
So are are you going to go for your Doctorate 
Probably not 
See I 'm in the Navy 
Yeah 
And uh you know most of the Navy funds that I probably wo n't do it until I if I do do it it will be after I get out of the Navy 
When do you get out 
Oh probably be another twelve years 
Oh okay 
Oh you know I like what I 'm doing right now 
But uh but what if they pay for it 
Excuse me 
What if they pay for 
If they pay for a 
Yeah 
Nah 
they wo n't pay for it 
They 've I think they have maybe two people a year go get get their 
Because I know I know a couple of people here that work for uh the Army Uh 
Yeah 
They civilians or uh military 
I think I think they 're military 
But I mean the guy is still in 
Uh-huh 
Uh-huh 
And uh h- uh he works over in Maryland 
Uh-huh 
And so he 's doing his Masters here 
They gave him like a scholarship like for a year 
Yeah 
And he 's doing it in like in a year and a summer 
Uh-huh 
And so he 's getting that 
and uh they said like they got a lot of benefits and that 
Yeah 
That 's why you want to join 
Uh-huh 
But uh this guy I mean you can earn a lot more money 
so you say I go why you still there if you can earn a lot more money once you 've get your your your Masters 
Uh-huh 
They go well they got a lot of benefits that would go with it 
so Well a lot of times it 's you know a lot of times it 's not the money that keeps pe- that keeps people in 
Yeah 
They they like what they 're doing 
They you know they feel good about what they 're doing 
That type of thing 
It 's more But I mean I mean you the once you get your Masters you can be earning between anywhere between like thirty-seven forty-five thousand a year 
Uh-huh 
And and that 's not what they 're paying 
Oh easily 
I 'm sure 
No 
Well it depends on what rank you are of course 
Yeah 
Yeah 
I know 
I mean like I say if you 're if you 're you know if you 're at an upper level in the rank category you know you 're probably pulling down close to seventy grand a year 
Yeah 
But that 's uh Yeah 
Those are few and far between though 
Yeah 
It 's like it 's like uh in I 
In I you can get certain points 
Uh-huh 
and uh everyone 's a manager 
But nobody can get one more point to become you know like whatever you need to earn so much money 
Yeah 
Since I imagine it 's fairly competitive 
Yeah 
It 's like no 
I I mean I is like there 's a joke about I which says you know it 's like uh all all the major companies get into a a boating race right 
Uh-huh 
And so I says well we have we have to have a team right 
Uh-huh 
And then they come in last 
and they have this whole team you know analyze why they came in last right Because the person asked for it 
Yeah 
Saying he goes uh the problem was that there were five people saying row row row and one person rowing right 
So he goes have you come up with a -lution uh have you come up with a solution 
They go yeah 
change the rower 
You know it 's like everyone 's a manager 
but you know it 's like only use like one person does the work 
Yeah 
so Too many chiefs and not enough Indians 
Yeah 
So Yeah 
I do n't know 
that can be that that can really slow you down 
Yeah 
Well that 's the way it works 
I mean that 's that 's why they 're having problems 
I mean everyone 's a manager 
and I did n't realize that 
Yeah 
I mean it 's like it 's like the people that actually do the work there are uh very few 
Uh-huh 
And then the other people just plan it you know 
It 's like it 's like have you have have you ever seen the commercial like for Federal Express where the with uh the think tank You know 
MUMBLEx push paper around 
Uh-huh 
like all these people are just standing sitting around just going you know like what shall we do 
Has anybody thought of anything 
No 
And then this guy from Federal Federal Express comes along 
They go what 's that This track which it 's going around the world 
and they can tell you where your package is anywhere any time 
Uh-huh 
And so it 's like the same thing with I You know 
so they have this think tank 
And they got to come up with ideas 
But see uh the the thing is that I is so stabilized that everybody will buy their stuff 
Yeah 
Oh yeah 
They 've got a they 've got basically a uh you know a lock on a lot of the market 
Yeah 
And a lot of times you figure you know with the support that they provide you know people generally go with that because they figure that the you know you probably wo n't get fired for getting I material 
Whereas if you try something different they 'll they 'll say yeah 
And it fails 
and you 're dead 
why did n't you buy why did n't you try something more mainline 
Yeah 
Well I does n't fire anybody 
Because uh what they do is they they put you in a different job Which y- you actually are like sitting around not doing anything 
No 
Uh-huh 
So you quit 
Uh 
I mean that 's their policy 
They never fire anybody unless you 're caught doing something illegally 
Illegal or something like that 
yeah 
Yeah 
like if you 're stealing something or doing anything like that 
Uh-huh 
But they wo n't let you off 
What they 'll do is like suppose you know like you 're a manager 
So they 'll put you into keeping up the paper you know 
Uh-huh 
It 's like how much paper is going in 
And then you say that 's not my job 
Uh-huh 
so you quit 
So in other words that 's the way they force people out 
Right 
That 's why they can say you know there 's no layoff policy 
Right 
But it does- they do n't really say that you know 
you 're you 're always going to have great career conditions 
Right 
He- hey that 's kind of sad 
No 
but I mean it 's like it 's like they they have just like different policy 
I do n't know 
My dad works for them 
but it 's like I like never in their commercials they never put down any other company you know 
It 's like they wo n't say No 
Well they 're the standard right now 
Or as far as that goes you know people think of computers they think of I a lot of times 
And the main Yeah 
Because see what happens is they have a good backup policy 
And anybody can fix it 
Uh-huh 
And so that 's what you 're going to go for 
Yeah 
Well you know that 's that 's a that 's a big thing 
And and you know it 's like for example like Leading Edge 
Have you ever heard of Leading Edge 
Yeah 
They are out of Korea right 
What 
Leading Edge 
Do n't they pro- They they made like uh small personal computers 
Yeah 
Small -s 
MUMBLEx they 're out of Korea right 
I do n't know 
I do n't know 
But what they do is what they did I do n't know is buy all the parts that I would throw away And build an I with all the parts that I would throw away 
Uh-huh 
Oh yeah 
Yeah 
MUMBLEx for example you test a chip 
It ca n't last seven years 
but it can last five 
I says let 's throw it away 
Leading Edge will say we 'll buy it from you 
Okay 
And so that 's I mean they 're still around I think 
Yeah 
I 've seen well I 've seen them around anyway You know MUMBLEx 
So that 's what they do 
They buy all all the things that I throws away 
and they MUMBLEx and that 's why they 're so compatible Because I mean Uh-huh 
and by the time you have computer for five years you 're going to throw it away anyway You know 
Most people do 
Or they have to anyway 
Well I mean there 's like well in a way you realize I mean one t- one of my teachers got this computer which you know it 's like uh voice uh synthesizing stuff 
Uh-huh 
And he got that 
He said you know it 's like uh I was testing it 
and it was wonderful 
And then when you tried to erase and correct you know all the errors in your voice it takes up all your memory 
Wow 
And I want more you know 
And it 's like Jesus Christ you know it 's like why do you want more 
Because it 's like one second of recording 
I mean you put into Wave 
Uh-huh 
and you want to correct the errors into Wave 
it takes so much I mean it 's like of course it does 
I mean by the times it transforms into Wave by mark off model 
and you put it in there 
and you want to correct those 
And then you know you 're trying to make the the Wave smooth 
so you can approximately of course it 's going to take a lot 
Imagine imagine what it is for us to make mark off models you know 
It 's amazing 
And uh during that whole month and then pay it at the end of the month 
Yeah 
Yeah 
I mean I get I get at least one or two a week People t- you know sending me a credit card or calling me on the phone and I just say I do n't want it 
Uh-huh 
Right 
Because I Well I think that 's the only thing you can do is just say no and mean no and not be tempted 
Yeah 
It 's like I 'd like to know where they determine that I 'm such a good credit risk that they can go and say you get this much credit line You know 
Well i- You 've already been preapproved 
oh absolutely 
preapproved 
That 's their favorite word 
Yes 
Everybody in the country is preapproved I think 
I think so you 're right 
So Well it 's interesting uh that uh people have the generally the same view of credit cards no matter where you go 
Yeah 
Uh-huh 
Yeah 
And then some people they get so wrapped up in them that they find you know one day they find wow I did n't realize I had this much you know I 'd spent this much money 
That much stuff 
Right 
And then they ca n't meet the minimum monthly payments on it 
Well and some people use one credit card to pay for another credit card they own 
Uh-huh 
and I mean that does nothing but exacerbate the entire problem 
Yeah 
it does because you 're you know you you 're you know you 're just co- costing yourself more money because you if you ca n't make the monthly the minimum payment you 're paying interest again 
That 's right 
so That 's right 
Yeah 
so Well it 's been enjoyable talking with you 
Yeah 
It 's enjoyable talking with seeing that somebody feels the same way 
so well Right 
Well take good care 
Take care of your little ones 
You you too 
Good luck 
Uh-huh 
Bye-bye 
Bye-bye 
All righty 
Uh I 'll just hand it off to you 
and hobbies in our spare time is what we 've been selected to discuss today 
Well uh the hobbies that I pursue in my spare time are crafts 
and uh I 've been involved in making uh hat stands and uh rag dolls and uh different type hats with uh flowers and roses you know and uh that kind of thing straw hats and all that kind of stuff 
Oh 
And I enjoy it 
it 's relaxing 
And you kind of get absorbed in it 
so the time goes by you know before you realize anything is going on 
And I play the organ sometimes uh just for my own satisfaction Not for anybody else 's ears 
because I 'm not that good at it 
but I like to bang on the keyboards once in a while 
Oh really 
How about yourself 
Well oh hobbies gee whiz 
I guess I got too many hobbies 
so I never have time to deal with them 
Really 
I like photography a lot 
Oh yeah 
that 's neat 
uh I used to do that a lot 
and then I like um we have a new child that will be a year old here next week 
so I 'll take a lot of pictures of her you know and spoil them 
Oh that 's great 
uh-huh 
first one you know how that is 
And um uh I play the guitar and a banjo 
I mainly play the guitar a lot 
I play about every night 
And um I really love that 
if I had a druther if I could have if I could make it on the road I 'd like to play on like a bluegrass band or something 
because that 's I 've Oh that sounds nice 
I like bluegrass too 
yeah 
I 've done it before and when I was in hi- in high school and college and thoroughly enjoyed it 
Uh-huh 
and it 's really a a blast 
My wife hates it 
but that 's the way life is I guess 
That 's the hard part right 
Exactly 
If you can do things together that really helps a lot 
MUMBLEx yeah 
we uh she 's uh into aerobics 
and uh and we did aerobics together for about a month and a half 
Oh that 's good too 
and that went over real well 
Uh-huh 
but uh that 's about it there 
Oh it 's good 
and it 's healthy too 
Oh yeah 
yeah 
We do that too 
we have a uh a treadmill and uh a bicycle and that kind of stuff 
we try to get twenty minutes like at least three for four times a week you know 
Oh that 's great 
Yeah 
That 's great 
And we like movies 
that ki- yeah 
Yeah 
that 's uh spare time 
with a child it 's kind of stra- she 's we have uh we 're looking for a baby-sitter 
so we 've been out twice in o- in this year so far By ourselves without the child 
Uh-huh 
so it 's kind of uh become an issue you could say 
Sure 
Um hobbies 
I like messing around in your house building things and you know putting cabinets up and those kind of things um 
Oh yeah 
that 's great too 
Uh-huh 
Yeah 
we did some remodeling when we bought a house 
we built put a kitchen in and um that kind of stuff and painting and some wallpapering 
that 's fun 
It 's really kind of fun 
It is 
It really is 
Especially if your spouse will get in there with you and get dirty 
yeah 
Yeah 
exactly 
I like things that you know two people can do 
but I like the quiet of doing things away you know 
kind of gives you some space for yourself 
and that 's what I find in making the dolls and things that it gives me something that I can create 
and I like to crochet and knit 
I made some afghans and that kind of stuff 
I like doing things with my hands 
Uh-huh 
Sounds like it 
Yeah 
Do you like to cook 
Yes 
I love to cook 
Yeah 
I love to cook too 
I 'm uh Italian food 
Oh really 
Yeah 
pizzas and spaghettis and lasagnas and that kind of stuff 
Well we 're all skinny farts 
so I it so when it comes to I like to cook and eat and to have mai- mainly I guess I get to MUMBLEx Yeah 
amount of people eat and then say man this is really good Uh-huh 
Yeah 
it is 
um um but it just work in the garden work around the yard of course 
Do you do barbecues 
Yes 
we sure do 
smoke them an- Well uh uh smoking and all that stuff 
Oh yeah 
all that hoedown stuff 
Yeah 
yep 
All that stuff that 's bad for you 
I I lived in Abilene for a little while and uh worked in the Abilene plant 
Oh sure 
yeah 
and we used to go to Joe Allen 's Barbecue 
and uh oh that was great 
Oh yeah 
Really great 
That 's uh only way to do it 
they have some nice stuff down there 
I miss it 
Well yeah 
it 's uh it 's uh it 's uh there 's uh there 's pluses to everything 
Oh yeah 
but you know seems like there 's just so many things to do down here 
I like the sports 
I play a lot of racquetball 
We did MUMBLEx I did horseback riding too 
in fact when my children were growing up we always had horses 
and uh that was kind of for them 
but they were n't as interested in it as we were you know 
so uh that was a real I 'd say probably for maybe fifteen years we dabbled in that you know 
we always had horses around 
and I really enjoyed that 
Oh that 's great 
sounds like you and I was disappointed when I went to Texas 
I did n't see that many of them 
Horses 
Yes 
Yeah 
you really do n't 
Yeah 
th- the you have to look real hard to see a lot of things besides concrete uh 
I know 
I know 
it 's true 
there 's buildings and concrete and a lot of people 
and that 's about it down here 
and so Uh-huh 
Yeah 
But uh that 's great 
Well sounds like you have a lot of nice hobbies there 
Yeah 
you too 
you too 
Well great 
well look uh 
I know it 's probably late for you 
Okay 
I enjoyed speaking with you 
Me too 
have a good weekend 
Okay 
Bye-bye 
Bye now 
Okay 
I do n't know 
which end do we push 
but okay 
Okay 
well um let 's see 
I I think there 's a lot of people that do n't vote because they do n't really think their their uh opinion is going to be heard 
and you know there 's such a small voice and such a huge number of people in the United States 
and that you know their yo- vote 's not going to make that much difference 
and whether you vote for one person or the other person the issues is what you know what you believe in 
and that person is going to have a lot of uh since there 's so many issues this one person can believe a lot of different ways on all of them 
Right 
yeah 
so it would be really difficult to have that one pers- perfect person that believed exactly what you believed 
That 's true 
you know a lot of people uh uh I think the that it ends up the people that uh vote every time uh elections come around are more the the polly uh the party type followers the guys that uh you know follow the party lines you know 
and they you know just go in 
Yeah 
and if they 're Republican they vo- vote Republican every year you know 
and uh the people that are independent you know are the ones that do n't uh do n't really uh show up every year because they ca n't seem to to decide which are the good aspects and which are the bad aspects of a candidate 
Right 
yeah 
Yeah 
that 's good 
Ye- I always thought it was back when Anderson was running I was hoping that things would change and he 'd actually get elected and party politics would start going down the tubes 
but um that did n't work 
Yeah 
Yeah 
there 's uh a lot of extremes on the parties too with the you know the real uh far side of the Democrats 
they 're real liberal now and to where probably fifty or a hundred years ago um the Democrat party being liberal like they are now you know would never be thought of 
it would be the other way that the Republicans were real liberal minded as far as like uh moral standings and those kinds of things 
Uh-huh 
But Yeah 
yeah 
that 's uh and then and then people always get upset about it too because you know every year the the the politicians are the ones that are usually pushing for more people to vote 
Uh-huh 
they they each think that uh if more people vote they 'll get more votes huh 
Yeah 
I 'm always amazed at that that each candidate thinks it 's going to be the people that come out that will vote for him you know 
Yeah 
That 's that 's true 
I think in uh the Texas governor elections I think more people turned out to vote against somebody than for somebody this time 
Yeah 
well that uh MUMBLEx I know that there 's certain issues that can really motivate people because we live in a pr- pr- predominately Catholic type area 
Oh really 
and when things start uh when when abortion comes on the issues and people just get all insp- inspired you know Right 
and uh still on the other hand we 're also uh this particular community is a Catholic community 
but uh uh down in where where things are a little bit different uh you know it 's it 's women 's rights and the and that sort of movement 
and so it 's uh quite the opposite 
so elections start getting very uh the elections where they have that topic seem to be a little bit better attended than some of the other ones 
Yeah 
that 's true 
But uh Yeah 
that 's true that the different places in America that uh you know different issues would be a lot more important than say in another place 
Yeah 
I can understand why why some of the the rural areas the voter turnout is n't as much because it does seem sometimes like the lobbyists in are like controlling things for the the Midwest 
Uh-huh 
and uh it does n't matter who they put in office they 're going to fall subject to uh the pressure that the lobbyists can put 
Right 
Yeah 
and it 's uh real true that uh you know they 'll say one thing to get elected 
and then once they do get elected they do n't have the power or the authority or the willingness to do those things that they promised you know beforehand 
Right 
You know maybe it just was n't possible at all in the first place you know like the no new taxes thing 
You know that 's uh with the economy going the way it is and everything that was nearly ridiculous thing to even try to do 
Yeah 
Yeah 
Well I do n't think he 's going to have to worry about that next year 
I think he can probably raise taxes and still get elected 
Right 
Uh 
Right 
after the war 
Uh-huh 
That really uh Unfortunately that will probably even drop lower the voters turndown MUMBLEx even more because more Democrats will think that they do n't have a shot 
so they wo n't even bother turning out 
Uh that 's true 
yeah 
They 'll just say oh well you know the Republicans have this election 
we 'll see you in four years 
Right 
Yeah 
MUMBLEx hope some of the local well that 's what they they keep saying that it seems like people with old-fashioned values are the ones that are n't turning out at the at the booths 
they they say that these older voters that uh you know they they feel like the kids are running the the country 
so they they do n't come out turn out to vote 
and they 're the ones that uh you know really know what 's going on have the experience and seen you know how politicians can you know screwup or what ever 
Uh-huh 
But I know my grandmother has n't voted in years 
Right 
that 's you know neither has mine as a matter of fact 
And uh that 's true 
they I think they look at it as well everybody the majority of the people think this way when that 's not necessarily true because you know that 's what the media says 
Well the majority believes this way 
so uh they do n't even bother turning out to vote to express their uh opinions 
So that 's that 's true 
Yeah 
wonder if they 're going to take into account MUMBLEx this computerized conversation that there 's little children you know bouncing in your knee the whole time you 're talking 
Yeah 
Do you hear the dogs in the background here 
No 
I ca n't hear them 
Okay 
they 're the children next door just opened the fence 
and they went off 
Oh yeah 
Yeah 
But anyway that 's I guess we 've uh talked long enough 
and uh that was sort of interesting 
Yeah 
What part of the country are you from 
Uh Washington 
Are you really 
Uh-huh 
Wow 
This is I 'm in from this is Dallas where I 'm at 
Oh okay 
The outskirts of Dallas 
Well I figured with Texas Instruments they 'd probably have a few uh Texans on the line now and then 
Yeah 
do do you work for I in any way 
No 
huh-uh 
Wow 
how did you how did they get you 
Um they MUMBLEx they went through engineering companies 
Oh 
and uh we 're communications 
I I work in a communications company 
Oh okay 
right 
I work for I 
so we saw it on the uh News one day 
and I thought wow that might be interesting 
Yeah 
MUMBLEx sort of different 
Yeah 
They called me at uh ten o'clock one night 
that was very strange 
Yeah 
I guess they were doing MUMBLEx Eastern Standard Time 
I was like I do n't know how long it takes whether it takes five minutes or twenty minutes 
Yeah 
Central Standard Time is what they 're doing it by 
Yeah 
Yeah 
I still have n't figured out what the zero through six days which day is which yet 
but I did n't study it that hard 
so maybe I 'll figure it out 
Uh-huh 
But anyway it was nice to talk to you and uh sort of meet you 
and that was an interesting topic 
Okay 
Yeah 
Okay 
well if you 're ever in uh come look up Wayne Sherman you 'll say oh yeah talked to that guy 
Okay 
I 'm I 'm Kyle Hunt too if you ever come to to Dallas area 
MUMBLEx Oh 
Okay 
We live right by the airport 
Yeah 
yeah 
so do we 
Oh okay 
Yeah 
right next to Dulles 
Yeah 
All right I 'll talk to you later 
Okay 
Bye-bye 
Bye 
Here goes Sharon 
Okay 
Well what do you think about Nolan Ryan being the first baseball player to earn a million dollars 
That 's the only thing I found out tonight 
Oh you found that out tonight 
Yeah 
I have n't even heard that 
that 's great 
I think he deserves every penny of it 
Yeah 
But there are some others out there that I do n't believe deserve the money they 're getting 
Well is n't it funny how baseball 's getting less than like football players would 
Oh yeah 
Wonder because football And they play a lot they play a lot longer season too 
And a lot more games right 
Yeah 
that 's exactly right 
Uh-huh 
But I think let 's see 
the teams that were there last year were see somebody from California 
I do n't even know who won the pennant last year 
Beats me 
I mean I know Yankees have won a lot games through the years 
Yeah 
Not lately though 
We have been talking about this 
I tried to call earlier 
Uh-huh 
and we had made a list of all these uh baseball teams and the cities that they were from MUMBLEx 
then I started cleaning 
and I do n't even know where I even put that paper 
Threw it away 
Yeah 
I was just cleaning and throwing 
Oh gosh 
Let 's see 
The teams that I think the A 's were in it last year 
The Oakland A 's and I think it was I do n't think it was an all California baseball 
Well have you ever played baseball 
I played softball 
Well that 's what I did when I was growing up 
Yeah 
That was fun 
Yeah 
that 's fun 
That 's a whole different sport 
Uh-huh 
Yeah 
let 's see 
but I think I think the Rangers need to go 
and I think the Pirates will go 
And uh let 's see 
Rangers have got a new guy this year 
I do n't even remember his name either 
Do you ever go see the Rangers 
Every once in a while I I like to go on the nights when there 's not anybody out there not very many people out there 
It 's a lot more fun when you 're not fighting a crowd 
Yeah 
I think it 's fun 
I like just looking at the billboards 
Yeah 
sometimes when I if you go out there during the day you just fry under the sun 
Yeah 
it 's nice at night 
Yeah 
That 's when I 've been 
It is Well And do you know anything about that new stadium 
have you seen all those pictures that they 're going to put out there 
No 
Yeah 
that that huge it 's suppose to be a huge stadium 
and it 's going to have little shopping centers in it and little like a lake or something running through it 
And uh they 're going to try to make it a real community center out there 
Cou- And you 're going to be able to buy your what was no wait MUMBLEx about the liquor That 's that 's in uh Texas stadium where the football players play 
Oh yeah 
so you and they 're never going to let liquor in there 
Well they 're trying 
I know 
but they try every year 
and every year they get thrown out 
It 's so stupid because they let you take it in there 
but they do n't they do n't allow you to sell it do n't allow them to sell it there 
Uh-huh 
But uh that new stadium 's going to be real nice 
and I heard that there 's uh that you can bid on that stadium 
last night on the news I heard that they said you could you could bid on the stadium to have it named after you 
so Uh-huh 
right 
And it 's going to go to the highest bidder 
Oh Well that 's the way to do it 
Yeah 
so that could be your you know fifteen minutes of fame 
You hear that 
That 's my kids turning on their music 
MUMBLEx Oh 
Holly turn it down 
I think it 's the Bart man the Simpsons 
Oh God I stay away from them 
I wish I could 
I bet you do 
Well where are you 
In Plano 
Okay 
I 'm in Garland 
Oh you are 
Yeah 
my h- my husband teaches in Plano 
Oh what 's he teach 
A 
Uh-huh 
So what do you do 
I teach 
but I teach for Dallas 
Oh you do 
For right now 
I 'm trying to get out 
Is that a tough system to be in 
Uh-huh 
Real hard 
Uh-huh 
Yeah 
I would think it 
I mean it 's good because they they try new things you know 
but it 's like they 'll try something 
and then they throw it out and get something else you know 
Yeah 
and you get tired of that 
That 's typical bureaucracy though 
That 's that 's I think it 's going to be any where you go 
it 's just worse in the bigger cities than it is in the smaller ones 
Yeah 
I do n't know 
sometimes the smaller ones are just as bad 
Well but they ca n't be though 
they do n't have as much money 
Yeah 
Most of the time 
but the politics the politics gets worse in the small towns sometimes 
Oh man in Dallas you do n't even know who 's in in administration 
there 's so many of them 
You do n't even know who to payoff huh 
I mean somebody walks in the a classroom 
and you do n't know what they 're there for you know when they 're coming how long they 're going to be 
Yeah 
oh how funny 
you know it 's just MUMBLEx there they are 
and they 're writing the whole time 
No communication whatsoever 
No 
I had them walk out of my class and not say their name anything 
and I finally just got to where I go okay I 'm Debbie Moore you know may I ask who you are and what you are in my classroom for you know 
Yeah 
Because you know you never know where they are going what they 'll report 
or I know 
and they 'll tell you they 've written something down 
and you hope they 're telling you the truth 
And you never see it 
No 
huh-uh 
That 's got to be frustrating 
Oh it is 
How long you taught taught in Dallas schools 
Uh this is my eleventh year 
Ugh that 's about uh ten too many 
No 
actually it 's now my job 's good much better than a lot because I 'm Chapter One 
Yeah 
Uh-huh 
Yeah 
and all I do is teach reading all day long 
Oh 
and it 's just ten children at a time 
Oh well that 's not bad 
No 
It 's good 
and you 've got a lot of federal money too 
But has n't it changed a lot over the years 
Teaching 
Yeah 
Oh yes 
Or working in the system 
Yes 
when I first started teaching I remember I went to my MUMBLEx and I said okay I want to see a curriculum guide you know 
so I 'll know what I 'm suppose to teach 
and they go we do n't have one 
We do n't even know where one is 
Oh God 
And so I go okay I mean you just you did what you wanted to do 
How funny 
and now they tell you what to teach and how long and you know what day what period 
Yeah 
you do n't know which is you do n't know which is worse 
Yeah 
No 
I know which is worse 
Yeah 
I guess so 
Yeah 
being told what to do is worse 
Uh-huh 
So how long are we suppose to talk for 
Well you can talk for ten minutes 
but you do n't have to 
Oh you can 
Yeah 
and no 
if you talk to ten then they come ov- on and say oh you 've extended your limit 
and please say good-bye within the next five seconds 
Oh I have n't ever talked that long 
Well you know I had n't either till last night I was talking to this retired administrator from Cleveland Ohio 
Uh-huh 
and we started talking about gangs you know 
He lives in Cleveland 
Yeah 
Wow 
And everybody else that I 've talked to has been right around here 
Yeah 
But she was real interesting 
Huh 
And then tonight this woman called 
have you taken any incoming calls 
Th- yours is my second one 
Okay 
So hers was the first one I got gotten 
and uh and she was telling me all her problems you know 
and it went over ten minutes 
Did she did she did you all not talk about the topic at all 
Well yeah 
we did 
but the topic was boring I thought 
Oh 
What would you serve uh if you were having a dinner party 
Oh gosh MUMBLEx all the other the one I talked about the other night was good 
it was um about movies you know what have you seen at the movies lately and stuff like that 
Oh yeah 
I could go on and on about that 
Me too because we go all the time 
the guy I was talking to never goes 
he was boy it sounds like you 're really up on this 
I said I see at least two a week 
Ugh neat 
So that was real good to talk about that 
Have you seen like uh 
No 
You 've got to go see that 
The last one I saw was MUMBLEx 
Yeah 
we talked about that one too 
And he he said he did n't think it should have gotten all those awards he thought it was too long 
but I Oh I enjoyed it 
I did too 
I mean it was just more for my money 
Yeah 
I did n't think it was too long at all 
Uh he said after about the first hour he started looking at his watch 
Huh 
The other one you need to go see is 
Uh-huh 
And how old are your kids 
One is eight 
and one is eleven 
You probably do n't want to take them to see 
It 's it 's not it 's not too cool for kids 
They usually pick their own 
I bet they do 
You know they 've got it all figured out 
Yeah 
they want to see all the horror movies 
Well and Ninja Turtles 
Yeah 
Ninja Turtles got to have those 
But most of the time really we watch them on the video 
Oh yeah 
you brin- that 's Do n't you 
Just massive rental 
well heck that 's a lot cheaper then uh taking them out to the show 
Going to I know 
Especially if you get them for a couple of nights you do n't have to watch them all in one ni- one time 
That 's what we do especially when it 's bad weather man just plug it in 
Yeah 
Of course you have to get there early if you want to get anything decent 
I know 
It 's good when you go to Tom Thumb though 
and they 're cheap 
and nobody has got them yet 
That 's true 
Unbelievable 
That 's true 
We saw um tonight 
Uh-huh 
It was okay 
it was kind of slow 
and I felt like it kind of got chopped off at the end you know 
It just it I do n't know 
it one of those movies it 's not going to be around long 
it will be a dollar movie in no time 
Do you read 
Not very much 
no 
No 
I do n't have the patience to read 
See I do that to make myself go to sleep at night 
Yeah 
Oh my Mom and Dad read all the time 
You saw right a long time ago 
Yeah 
sure did 
Well I was reading the book 
and it 's called 
Oh really 
It was so wonderful 
And then I was um I decided well I like this author 
so I got a uh book of his short stories 
and that 's been real good 
Who is the is the author 
Do n't do n't ask me 
Oh 
The was the name of the book 
Shoeless Joe 
Was it like the movie 
Yes 
Okay 
quite a quite a bit 
But you know in the movie the guy was black 
Right 
he was n't in the book 
Huh 
that 's one difference 
There really was n't a lot of difference 
I did n't 
see I never even heard that there was a book tied in with that movie 
That 's interesting 
That was a good movie too 
Well do you think we covered baseball 
I think so 
Okay 
well have a good night 
Okay 
I 'll let you start first okay 
Okay 
We um I 'm presently living in a house uh 
first time uh we had the house built 
and so this is our our fifth year in it I guess 
and uh um it was a real excitement to uh to go out and select the house and have one made and built 
and like you wanted it we were the fourth to build out of three hundred and forty houses 
And um as we did with probably ninety-five percent of the people here in Dallas-Fort Worth we bought a Fox and Jacobs home 
and they 're good for about five years or four years 
and after that they start falling apart 
So I would uh not recommend and house for my dog to live in uh because they 're overpriced uh 
but they 're a cheap house 
If you ca n't afford something good you know 
they 're good for that 
and um you can call it a home because it 's a place to go home and keep the rain off your head 
but as far as the costs for what you 're getting uh the longevity of the house is not uh is not worth it 
How about in your case 
Well in my case my husband is not a carpenter 
but in fact he 's in electronics 
but he knew the only way we 'd ever have a new home is if he would build it 
So it took him about two and a half years 
but uh he built us a house 
it 's uh we have thirty-two hundred square feet 
and it 's a brick house 
and price-wise it was great because he did it all himself you know 
so that way he could we could kind of control in control it 
Uh-huh 
and uh we live in kind of a small town 
Uh-huh 
and I mean it 's nothing fancy you know 
it 's it 's a house 
it 's nice 
and it 's real pretty 
and we 're all comfortable in it 
Well that 's great 
that 's great 
that 's uh I 've heard I have another gentleman friend of mine who uh who had a house built 
as a matter of fact another guy is building one now 
he 's been doing it for three years 
and the city 's a little upset with him 
but I understand you save a lot of money off uh by doing that 
and uh Oh you can because that way you 're not having to pay the middle men and everybody else 
Nothing wrong with that 
You know 
uh I 'll vouch for that 
Um 
But uh of course my husband did everything except my brother 's a trim carpenter 
and he came in you know and did the inside for us 
and that helped 
That was a big savings 
And uh yes 
and uh we had to hire of course the plumbing and the brick and everything else nothing you know 
he did everything else We 've been in it six years 
Well that 's great 
uh have you been in it long 
Oh really 
well have you any plans to uh maybe uh expand or move onward 
no 
we 're well uh our kids are kind of still small now 
and we had thought before maybe a lot older we do n't need such a large house that we 'll sell it 
but he will not build a second one himself Because he says age-wise he 'll never be able to handle that again 
I see 
well First one is always a bear 
Yes 
yes 
We 're having a an architect friend of mine design a house for us 
and that can basically be be put on any lot in any state any kin- you know 
so that 's kind of we just got with him and told him what all we wanted 
Oh 
Uh-huh 
and he 's charging us about a buck a square foot to design it 
and he 's re- certified and registered 
so at least we know we 're it 's not going to fall in or something if it 's built 
Yeah 
oh 
But uh I have heard that your approach is is right 
you can actually go out and sub it if even if you do n't want to get hands on 
Uh-huh 
you can even just sub it out to concrete and those kind of things 
and and that 's kind of the plan I have 
so I 'm uh Yeah 
everyone I talk to uh I file in my little book and do other things with it MUMBLEx 
That 's great 
that 's great 
But uh like I said otherwise you know a- the expense but you know we could not have one as large as we have if you know we had n't did it ourselves 
Sure 
I can imagine 
Yeah 
I mean it 's not an Eldorado house or anything like that 
but you know it 's ours 
If you 're happy with it that 's all that counts 
That 's right 
That 's right 
That 's all 
on- you only have to uh satisfy yourself and no one else 
Ap- apparently the appraisers likes it because our taxes sure is high 
Oh that 's uh that 's uh an encouraging sign if you ever want to resell I guess 
Is n't it 
It really is 
because I I 'm always shocked at about you know what they have it appraised at 
I think oh my goodness 
MUMBLEx Well that 's great 
Well yeah 
I guess that about does it 
Okay 
and it was nice talking to you 
Nice talking with you too 
Okay 
bye-bye 
Bye 
Well the thing is is that I um since I 'm in school I do n't like basically have a monthly budget because I 'm living off my dad 
but the thing is is that um I have to keep it under control because for example you know it 's like the the beginning of the semester when you go to pay for everything everything is pretty rough 
but he controls that part 
but then whenever you know it 's like once the semester starts I 'm the one who has to control how much spending there is 
And the only thing that I I basically spend my money on is just food 
and um so What about tuition and rent 
Who takes care of that 
Well the thing is is that I live in a dorm 
Uh 
So uh what happens is you pay six hundred dollars at the beginning or even before school starts 
Yeah 
And then the tuition is also the same thing 
So the thing is is basically that I spend like maybe thirty-five forty dollars every two weeks on on groceries 
and that 's about it 
But the thing uh also is that you know like if you want to go out like if you want to go to a restaurant or something then I have to moderate that because it 's like I ca n't go eat out at a nice restaurant and spend twenty dollars um you know three times a week 
No 
you ca n't do that very often 
So I mean it 's for for us you know it 's like I I can spend I can spend that money 
but it 's not it 's not what I want to spend it on you know 
Are are you working anywhere while you are going to school 
No 
Okay 
Because um they do n't allow me to work since uh I 'm a foreign student 
Oh okay 
And so they the government does n't allow me to work 
Yeah 
so all the money comes from home 
Uh-huh 
So you got to make uh so how do you keep track of where you are in in your monthly spending 
Well the thing is is that um I ba- I basically know how much I have right 
Right 
And so the thing is is that I I can tell like uh I I get all my money out of the teller 
Yeah 
And besides see one of my biggest expenses is telephone calls since I have to call you know international 
Where do you call to 
Argentina 
Argentina 
Yeah 
Wow 
And so the bas- one of the problems is that I spend too much money on phone bills 
Yeah 
talk too long 
Well that 's they they want me to call down there every so often 
Yeah 
I mean I told my dad li- Dad listen if you want to save money I wo n't call so often you know 
he goes we want to keep in touch 
so I does n't matter about the money because we need to hear from you 
Yeah 
so you call him collect 
No 
Because it is more expensive that way 
What makes you think so 
Any any um basically the United States is the cheapest country to call out of 
Yeah 
And um because it 's considered a luxury in other countries 
Oh okay 
So you just call him direct 
and then Right 
Since it 's his money anyway you know 
Yeah 
And he gets the and you get the bill and send it to him 
No 
Um I got money to pay that too 
Okay 
So it 's basically you know it 's like it 's not too much money 
and it 's not too little money 
so I wo n't have to you know rush a letter to him or something 
Yeah 
because um he really wants me to concentrate on my studies 
Yeah 
What are you what are you studying 
I 'm doing masters in computer science and computer engineering 
And what do you think you 'll do with that 
With those degrees 
Uh-huh 
Well I can I can work up um here up to a year 
And 
And hopefully get a job after that 
You want to get into some kind of manufacturing 
or what 's the specialty that you 're looking for 
Um computer communications and data transmissions 
Oh okay 
so you want to find a uh data transmissions you 're looking for uh um long distance type stuff 
Right 
Yeah 
you know anywhere from um local area networks metropolitan area networks you know all that 
and so well you have a family right 
Yeah 
I have a wife and two children 
and um And does does your wife work 
No 
She does n't work 
she does uh well it 's kind of hard to say now days um other than taking care of the house she does a lot of sewing herself 
Oh okay 
And she gets paid for that 
so she brings some money in 
Yeah 
She is trying to start he- her own business where she does that full time Alterations and sewing Stuff for the public 
Okay 
Yeah 
and uh do that on a on a full time basis here in town 
And so and you have a monthly budget 
Well s- sort of 
We 're probably like most Am- American families I guess that we sort of have a budget in that we know how much we 've got at the end of the month 
Right 
and we know what bills have to be paid 
and uh we pay as many of those bills that can be paid with with the monthly budget 
so So you do n't have any problem in um overcharging on your credit card and stuff like that 
Oh sure 
We 're like everybody else you know 
we 've got a several credit cards that sometimes um instead of paying them all off every month maybe you have to slip some and you pay part of it this month and part of it next month especially around Christmas time 
Yeah 
yeah 
You know that 's when everybody goes crazy on charging stuff 
Well then uh see uh that 's that 's one of the points which I do n't see 
like I I do n't give a lot of gifts during Christmas 
and I you know I do n't wa- I do n't like to give any at all 
Yeah 
because the thing is is that you know it 's like if I want something I 'll I 'll ask somebody you know 
Yeah 
like like uh for Chr- uh for Christmas my roommate goes what do you want 
And I said I want a backpack 
Yeah 
You kno- no 
I told him yo- if you want to give me a present for Christmas give me a backpack 
Yeah 
that 's something that you can use 
Right 
because I I needed a backpack 
So he gave me a backpack 
and I I knew he needed an alarm clock 
Yeah 
So I bought him an alarm clock 
So the thing was that that That 's great Utilitarian 
Right 
but Necessary things no frivolous gifts 
right 
but um the thing is especially remember when I was down in Argentina it was to me it was ridiculous 
because you know you have to once a year you go out 
and you spend all this money on all these people 
and some you do n't care about you know 
it 's like That 's true 
why bother 
Yeah 
Yeah 
And so but the thing is is that um Well especially being a college student yo- your I do n't know that you need to be involved in a lot of frivolous gift giving you know 
Yeah 
that effects the budget especially around uh Christmas time 
at the end of the semester you 've got finals and lots of bills I would suspect 
Yeah 
What about when you have breaks like um Christmas or between sessions 
Well for example we had spring break now 
and I went skiing 
and I spent around like maybe two hundred dollars
