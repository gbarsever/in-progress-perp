Yeah 
Those are pretty 
Number one turned out just great 
and the lady said she could n't believe that they know that I had done it in the colors that they had decorated the nursery 
and I did n't even know it 
Oh that 's a MUMBLEx I gave it to her 
and she said how did you know those are the colors we used 
I said did n't 
That was a good MUMBLEx It worked out that way 
That 's great 
Uh that uh now I 've got the material to do an afghan that I just never did get around to finishing it 
Uh-huh 
I like those 
Those are pretty 
Yeah 
Lilly Lilly she said she said it 's for your daughter to use 
Oh no 
She said I know she does n't get to touch it 
She hung it on the wall 
Yes 
my uh grandmother um made us a couple of quilts for the baby 
and I was like oh I do n't want to mess those up 
Yeah 
Uh they 're just too nice 
I mean you do n't get many hand made quilts anymore 
Yeah 
Oh yeah 
True 
Well I 've enjoyed this 
Okay 
But uh well keep up the good um 
keep up the cross-stitching 
You too 
All right 
thanks 
Uh-huh 
bye bye 
Bye bye 
Okay 
The topic is to discuss the uh sources where I receive news 
Uh-huh 
And uh for me that 's mostly newspaper and radio 
I almost never watch television as a matter of course 
so I do n't get news from television 
except during the war I watched a lot of because it was so good 
Uh-huh 
Well why was the only of course I think Saddam Hussein only allowed to broadcast it 
is that not true 
Um 
It was unusual not to have the different sources you know of news coverage 
Yeah 
Um I do n't know 
I guess uh I do n't even know why I watched 
I guess I just wanted more news 
It 's one of the few times I wanted more news than Yeah 
well I know even if you watched A or the other 
I mean what 's the other one uh 
They all were were tapped into 
Were they 
Uh-uh 
Yeah 
That 's the only thing they broadcast 
and like you I listened to radio on my job at work 
Uh-huh 
And all this week they have been having this uh a discussion about that is why uh why was well I listen to a Christian radio station 
Uh-huh 
And they were saying that is definitely a world uh news service 
and uh they it was you ca n't really be sure of the quality of what you 've got you know 
Huh 
Uh we had some uh some people from our church went to Israel uh just for a uh tour sort of thing 
Uh-huh 
And I was watching on 
they they broadcast this terrible riot 
supposedly that was going on in Jerusalem 
so we got all fearful for our people come to find out they came back and said they were n't even aware of it 
Right 
and so it really made me question as to what how do we know you know uh if the news we 're getting is any good 
So Yeah 
I guess the news just focuses on major events that probably do n't affect ninety-nine percent of the people who are right there when the news is being made 
Yeah 
Right 
right 
But uh I I 'm from California 
and I can remember being in uh in these earthquakes 
and I mean they were they were very minor kinds of things from my point of view and it seemed you know from anyone else 's point of view 
Yeah 
but they get all blown up in the news Um 
Uh-huh 
Well I I find it depressing to watch our specially you know it 's just uh local news concentrates on murders and things like that 
I 'm from Dallas 
and uh we have a lot of bad stuff uh 
it just really gets me depressed even to watch it 
Uh-huh 
Uh-huh 
Yeah 
So then you wake up one morning 
and you are in war with somebody 
you do n't even even know about it 
Right 
So Well what newspapers uh do you read in Dallas 
Uh we have the and the 
but I do n't I do n't read newspapers 
Do n't you 
Huh-uh 
How come 
Uh-huh 
I find it hard to uh follow from one page to another 
It 's just something I have never developed uh an interest in 
Huh 
And I live in kind of a bad area where if I have the paper delivered it 's stolen before I can get out and get it 
Gosh that 's that sounds pretty bad to me 
I mean who would steal a newspaper 
You would be surprised 
Huh 
They just come by and pick them up even if it 's just for the you know t- uh selections of the day 
I see 
I do n't know 
It just would n't be there whenever I tried it 
Yeah 
So you 're right 
who would steal a newspaper 
But they do 
Yeah 
What part of California are you from 
Uh from Los Angeles 
but I live in Raleigh North Carolina right now 
that 's where I am speaking to you from 
Oh okay 
But I grew up in A 
I work out here 
Huh you work for I 
No 
I do n't 
I work for North Carolina State University 
Huh 
But uh I know some people at I 
and I have a couple of students who have graduated and gone to work for them 
Yeah 
So I 'm in the computer business 
Well I boy current events is not a good subject for me 
Well I do n't keep up with it that often 
Let 's see I 've I 've I 've never done this before 
I mean I 've never This is your first call 
This is my first call Because I just got my password 
Oh really 
Yeah 
So I do n't know 
are we suppose to it seems to me it says you are suppose to talk for three minutes 
but I think we 've been talking for three minutes 
and nobody has interrupted 
Yeah 
well I I got into a conversation last night with a lady 
and they interrupt at ten minutes 
I see 
So if we 've done our three minutes Let 's just let the conversation end and say bye 
Uh-huh 
Well all right 
Nice talking to you 
Nice talking to you too 
All right 
bye 
Bye-bye 
Hello 
Hello 
Hey how you doing 
Not bad 
not bad 
What 's your name 
Fernando 
Fernando 
My name is Nick 
Wait 
Let me turn off my stereo here 
Sure 
Because I 've been like waiting like for about ten minutes to get connected to somebody 
Really 
Yeah 
Phew 
Man I 'm Yeah 
What time is it over th- 
are you are you in Dallas 
No 
no 
I 'm in Detroit 
Or not Detroit I 'm in uh California 
Are you 
Yeah 
I Because every time I got through I went to Dallas Texas 
Really 
Yeah 
I 'm in North Carolina 
Oh 
Well you 're on the uh let 's see 
On the other coast 
Yeah 
twenty-one 
Yeah 
Shoot man it 's what midnight almost 
What 
Yeah 
yeah 
It 's uh I 'm watching here 
Yeah 
okay 
All right 
Well I guess we 're supposed to talk 
what about 
credit card 
wait 
Wh- what did how how did you get to know about the I thing 
Oh one of my instructors uh said that they were doing something like this 
and Wha- what are you working on 
A a Masters in uh information systems 
Really 
I 'm doing my Masters in in computer science and computer engineering 
Yeah 
Where at 
At North Carolina State University 
Hey 
How do you like it out there 
Uh I do n't Because uh I come from a lot a bigger city than this one 
and I I 'm in Raleigh 
Yeah 
and Oh 
Raleigh Durham 
Yeah 
Yeah 
That area 
And it 's really small 
All all you have is like towns built around universities 
Uh-huh 
Like Chapel Hill 
Yeah 
So it it 's basically a bunch of small towns anyway 
Kind of quaint little towns 
but they do n't have a whole lot there 
Yeah 
Where you at 
Uh well I 'm in Monterey California right now 
Yeah 
Oh okay 
So so I mean it 's like this this town probably has like two hundred and fifty thousand people 
and that 's about it 
Two hundred fifty 
Yeah 
Okay 
It it 's it 's a lot bigger than Monterey is 
But we 're just uh just south of uh San Jose and San Francisco 
Oh okay 
And it 's only a couple of hours away or a hour away to a you know to a large city 
So so where do you go 
Do you go to Berkeley 
No 
no 
I go to the it 's the naval postgraduate school out here 
Oh okay 
Because uh I was looking at at the doctorate degree in computer science center at Berkeley 
Uh-huh 
And they 're asking like for a uh A of like three point seven or something like that 
Uh-huh 
And like they 're looking like for uh like ninety-nine percentile and this and that 
Yeah 
And it 's like Well that 's what they look for 
Whether or not they get it is hard to say 
Yeah 
I know 
That 's why that 's why I did n't apply 
I mean it was like for me it was like practically impossible to get between like ninety and ninety-nine percentile on the on the verbal part 
Yeah 
Yeah 
It 's pretty tough 
It 's pretty tough 
I uh let 's face it you know 
And you know I you know did the you know as far as I found it a lot of times with regards to education you know the school only takes you so far you know 
It 's what you do You know 
Yeah 
So uh I do n't lose any sleep sleep over stuff like that 
So are are you going to go for your Doctorate 
Probably not 
See I 'm in the Navy 
Yeah 
And uh you know most of the Navy funds that I probably wo n't do it until I if I do do it it will be after I get out of the Navy 
When do you get out 
Oh probably be another twelve years 
Oh okay 
Oh you know I like what I 'm doing right now 
But uh but what if they pay for it 
Excuse me 
What if they pay for 
If they pay for a 
Yeah 
Nah 
they wo n't pay for it 
They 've I think they have maybe two people a year go get get their 
Because I know I know a couple of people here that work for uh the Army Uh 
Yeah 
They civilians or uh military 
I think I think they 're military 
But I mean the guy is still in 
Uh-huh 
Uh-huh 
And uh h- uh he works over in Maryland 
Uh-huh 
And so he 's doing his Masters here 
They gave him like a scholarship like for a year 
Yeah 
And he 's doing it in like in a year and a summer 
Uh-huh 
And so he 's getting that 
and uh they said like they got a lot of benefits and that 
Yeah 
That 's why you want to join 
Uh-huh 
But uh this guy I mean you can earn a lot more money 
so you say I go why you still there if you can earn a lot more money once you 've get your your your Masters 
Uh-huh 
They go well they got a lot of benefits that would go with it 
so Well a lot of times it 's you know a lot of times it 's not the money that keeps pe- that keeps people in 
Yeah 
They they like what they 're doing 
They you know they feel good about what they 're doing 
That type of thing 
It 's more But I mean I mean you the once you get your Masters you can be earning between anywhere between like thirty-seven forty-five thousand a year 
Uh-huh 
And and that 's not what they 're paying 
Oh easily 
I 'm sure 
No 
Well it depends on what rank you are of course 
Yeah 
Yeah 
I know 
I mean like I say if you 're if you 're you know if you 're at an upper level in the rank category you know you 're probably pulling down close to seventy grand a year 
Yeah 
But that 's uh Yeah 
Those are few and far between though 
Yeah 
It 's like it 's like uh in I 
In I you can get certain points 
Uh-huh 
and uh everyone 's a manager 
But nobody can get one more point to become you know like whatever you need to earn so much money 
Yeah 
Since I imagine it 's fairly competitive 
Yeah 
It 's like no 
I I mean I is like there 's a joke about I which says you know it 's like uh all all the major companies get into a a boating race right 
Uh-huh 
And so I says well we have we have to have a team right 
Uh-huh 
And then they come in last 
and they have this whole team you know analyze why they came in last right Because the person asked for it 
Yeah 
Saying he goes uh the problem was that there were five people saying row row row and one person rowing right 
So he goes have you come up with a -lution uh have you come up with a solution 
They go yeah 
change the rower 
You know it 's like everyone 's a manager 
but you know it 's like only use like one person does the work 
Yeah 
so Too many chiefs and not enough Indians 
Yeah 
So Yeah 
I do n't know 
that can be that that can really slow you down 
Yeah 
Well that 's the way it works 
I mean that 's that 's why they 're having problems 
I mean everyone 's a manager 
and I did n't realize that 
Yeah 
I mean it 's like it 's like the people that actually do the work there are uh very few 
Uh-huh 
And then the other people just plan it you know 
It 's like it 's like have you have have you ever seen the commercial like for Federal Express where the with uh the think tank You know 
MUMBLEx push paper around 
Uh-huh 
like all these people are just standing sitting around just going you know like what shall we do 
Has anybody thought of anything 
No 
And then this guy from Federal Federal Express comes along 
They go what 's that This track which it 's going around the world 
and they can tell you where your package is anywhere any time 
Uh-huh 
And so it 's like the same thing with I You know 
so they have this think tank 
And they got to come up with ideas 
But see uh the the thing is that I is so stabilized that everybody will buy their stuff 
Yeah 
Oh yeah 
They 've got a they 've got basically a uh you know a lock on a lot of the market 
Yeah 
And a lot of times you figure you know with the support that they provide you know people generally go with that because they figure that the you know you probably wo n't get fired for getting I material 
Whereas if you try something different they 'll they 'll say yeah 
And it fails 
and you 're dead 
why did n't you buy why did n't you try something more mainline 
Yeah 
Well I does n't fire anybody 
Because uh what they do is they they put you in a different job Which y- you actually are like sitting around not doing anything 
No 
Uh-huh 
So you quit 
Uh 
I mean that 's their policy 
They never fire anybody unless you 're caught doing something illegally 
Illegal or something like that 
yeah 
Yeah 
like if you 're stealing something or doing anything like that 
Uh-huh 
But they wo n't let you off 
What they 'll do is like suppose you know like you 're a manager 
So they 'll put you into keeping up the paper you know 
Uh-huh 
It 's like how much paper is going in 
And then you say that 's not my job 
Uh-huh 
so you quit 
So in other words that 's the way they force people out 
Right 
That 's why they can say you know there 's no layoff policy 
Right 
But it does- they do n't really say that you know 
you 're you 're always going to have great career conditions 
Right 
He- hey that 's kind of sad 
No 
but I mean it 's like it 's like they they have just like different policy 
I do n't know 
My dad works for them 
but it 's like I like never in their commercials they never put down any other company you know 
It 's like they wo n't say No 
Well they 're the standard right now 
Or as far as that goes you know people think of computers they think of I a lot of times 
And the main Yeah 
Because see what happens is they have a good backup policy 
And anybody can fix it 
Uh-huh 
And so that 's what you 're going to go for 
Yeah 
Well you know that 's that 's a that 's a big thing 
And and you know it 's like for example like Leading Edge 
Have you ever heard of Leading Edge 
Yeah 
They are out of Korea right 
What 
Leading Edge 
Do n't they pro- They they made like uh small personal computers 
Yeah 
Small -s 
MUMBLEx they 're out of Korea right 
I do n't know 
I do n't know 
But what they do is what they did I do n't know is buy all the parts that I would throw away And build an I with all the parts that I would throw away 
Uh-huh 
Oh yeah 
Yeah 
MUMBLEx for example you test a chip 
It ca n't last seven years 
but it can last five 
I says let 's throw it away 
Leading Edge will say we 'll buy it from you 
Okay 
And so that 's I mean they 're still around I think 
Yeah 
I 've seen well I 've seen them around anyway You know MUMBLEx 
So that 's what they do 
They buy all all the things that I throws away 
and they MUMBLEx and that 's why they 're so compatible Because I mean Uh-huh 
and by the time you have computer for five years you 're going to throw it away anyway You know 
Most people do 
Or they have to anyway 
Well I mean there 's like well in a way you realize I mean one t- one of my teachers got this computer which you know it 's like uh voice uh synthesizing stuff 
Uh-huh 
And he got that 
He said you know it 's like uh I was testing it 
and it was wonderful 
And then when you tried to erase and correct you know all the errors in your voice it takes up all your memory 
Wow 
And I want more you know 
And it 's like Jesus Christ you know it 's like why do you want more 
Because it 's like one second of recording 
I mean you put into Wave 
Uh-huh 
and you want to correct the errors into Wave 
it takes so much I mean it 's like of course it does 
I mean by the times it transforms into Wave by mark off model 
and you put it in there 
and you want to correct those 
And then you know you 're trying to make the the Wave smooth 
so you can approximately of course it 's going to take a lot 
Imagine imagine what it is for us to make mark off models you know 
It 's amazing
