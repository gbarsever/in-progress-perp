it could go besides itbe&3S a bench for the kitchen table 

okay 

that little tiny room be&3S the live-PRESP room 

now 

yes 

well I think that the small-SP room ought_to be the +nbath+nroom 

uhhuh 

uhhuh 

uhhuh 

uhhuh 

yes 

be&3S it in the bag 

thatbe&3S where all the furniture be&3S as far as I know 

be&3S it empty 

maybe we do&PASTnot bring the toilet then 

I guess we do&PASTnot bring it 

where doe-PL what belong 

the wrench 

uhhuh 

use the wrench 

oh good 

Ibe&1S so glad 

wonder where it be&PAST&13S 

oh 

maybe it be&PAST&13S in the car or something 

maybe so 

whobe&3S go-PRESP to put&ZERO the car back together 

whobe&3S go-PRESP to put&ZERO it back together 

no 

webe&PRES not leave-PRESP 

I just wonder-PASTP if you know&PAST how to put&ZERO it back together 

because when you be&PAST little you do&PASTnot know how 

can you do it now 

who 

can you 

I think you take&PAST it all apart 

no you donot 

uhuh 

maybe Lois will play with the steer-PRESP wheel while you turn the screw 

yes 

no 

you see&PAST a wheel in the back 

can I ask a question 

okay we have_to write them after every step 

after every step 

you need a red screw Pete 

you can use a +nscrew+ndriver if you want to make it tight 

now itbe&3S tight 

that go-3S where it be&PAST&13S 

yes 

put&ZERO the hood on 

thatbe&3S the wrong side 

you have_to make these thing-PL fit&ZERO those thing-PL in the hole-PL I think 

there you go 

now you can screw it in 

there you go 

now you can screw it in 

right here 

now if you put&ZERO the other wooden cm side on you can put&ZERO the wheel-PL on 

the blue bolt on the yellow screw 

wherebe&3S the yellow screw 

do you see 

oh itbe&3S behind you Peter 

there it be&3S right there 

very good 

now therebe&3S the wheel-PL and the headlight-PL 

put&ZERO the little bolt inside 

thatbe&3S a good idea 

I do&PASTnot know you know&PAST how to put&ZERO it back together 

those be&PRES the headlight-PL and the taillight-PL 

the other one be&3S behind you 

yes 

you have_to put&ZERO the screw-PL in to make it look like headlight-PL though 

yes 

I think itbe&3S a combination of the headlight-PL and bump&dv-AGT I guess 

yes 

Ibe&1S sure we have_to push it from the back 

yeah 

it already have&3S a bolt 

thatbe&3S right 

herebe&3S your screw 

therebe&3S another blue screw behind you 

letus see now 

itbe&3S almost do&PASTP 

Ibe&1S very surprise-PASTP that you could do the whole thing 

because when you be&PAST just a little boy 

you couldnot put&ZERO the car back together 

do&PAST you know that 

there it be&3S 

whew 

very good 

that be&PAST&13S good 

all finish-PASTP

we do&PASTnot bring all the furniture because we have&PAST to come so far 

you know we have&PAST to come a long way today 

so we do&PASTnot bring all the furniture 

we can fix each room 

because we have&PAST so far to come thatbe&3S why we do&PASTnot bring you then 

but we can fix up each room a little bit 

maybe the next time we come but we willnot be come-PRESP tomorrow 

because we just be&PRES go-PRESP to come one time this time instead of two time-PL 

because itbe&3S so far 

itbe&3S a long trip

yeah 

itbe&3S about a hour 

it take-3S about a hour 

thatbe&3S right 

and then we can walk to our house from there 

okay 

letus see 

we could make this the live-PRESP room 

the whole family in the live-PRESP room 

and we could put&ZERO this in the live-PRESP room 

this bench 

and maybe we could put&ZERO one of these chest-PL in the live-PRESP room too 

and we could even take some of the furniture from that house and put&ZERO it in this on 

we could get the table and put&ZERO it in here 

therebe&3S only one table 

you know we could get that round one in there and theregenmod be two table-PL 

why donot you put&ZERO that one in this room 

so therewill be one in each room instead of have-PRESP all in the same room 

not big enough 

like this
